1
01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:27.630
Zeljko Ivezic: Good morning, People on zoom.

2
01:20:29.670 --> 01:20:33.070
Zeljko Ivezic: We'll wait a couple of more minutes. People are slowly freaking in.

3
01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:54.730
Zeljko Ivezic: Will you start

4
01:21:57.490 --> 01:22:03.000
Zeljko Ivezic: so today like to 3. We are going to introduce some new concepts.

5
01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:07.620
Zeljko Ivezic: Typically, still, by using a statistics, is not

6
01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:12.050
Zeljko Ivezic: thought in classes that she would take as a physicist or chemist for

7
01:22:12.190 --> 01:22:23.180
Zeljko Ivezic: any other, because it's relatively new development in statistics. But, on the other hand, it is actually older than classical or the

8
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:25.890
Zeljko Ivezic: I will go to some of this.

9
01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:30.460
Zeljko Ivezic: It's there's some new concepts that we will produce.

10
01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:33.720
Zeljko Ivezic: and so trigger warning. Once you

11
01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:40.410
Zeljko Ivezic: here, it is for the first time. It's very easy to get lost. So i'm hoping that

12
01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:58.680
Zeljko Ivezic: if not all of that is clear, you will go again over the lecture today. But there are also few excellent references that you can read, which are more narrative, and they contain

13
01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:04.120
Zeljko Ivezic: more material than I can

14
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:17.290
Zeljko Ivezic: sure. So, in particular, I highly recommend day. One of classes blog treatment is, and by Cnn. Is a practical introduction. Jake is an excellent writer.

15
01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:33.340
Zeljko Ivezic: and in addition there is this python-driven trainer or printer, where you can get python exercises and simple numerical Simon patients, where he emphasizes

16
01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:44.730
Zeljko Ivezic: similarities and differences between the frequentist approach and by the Asian approach. And what that really means we will talk about today.

17
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:46.810
and then 80.

18
01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:50.420
Zeljko Ivezic: You want to learn more in the context of the grassland.

19
01:23:50.670 --> 01:24:04.180
Zeljko Ivezic: We regretfully. We will not have a a lot to to limited amount of time, then part Bobby and land they can. Analysis recipes speaking a model for data.

20
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:16.480
Zeljko Ivezic: He's on a on archive easily accessible, and it has a very nice, but they go to how introduction to approach to regression, meaning

21
01:24:17.210 --> 01:24:17.940
Zeljko Ivezic: the

22
01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:30.000
Zeljko Ivezic: in functions to your data points. In one day or more we will cover some of that today next time, but it will not be as extensive as that excellent paper that they put up.

23
01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:39.600
Zeljko Ivezic: And then there is a little Bible, a little book by David. There's Cva and Jake's Killing data analysis, a Bayesian tutorial.

24
01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:47.330
Zeljko Ivezic: When I took statistics and college here in Zagreb I never heard of by the Asian

25
01:24:47.620 --> 01:25:01.210
Zeljko Ivezic: statistics, and then I had roommate in Red School and started reading articles about it to of the businesses. He introduced me to this concept, and then for my birthday. He gave me this book by Cv. And

26
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:06.620
Zeljko Ivezic: Jake's killing, and they change my whole view of statistics, and

27
01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:18.100
Zeljko Ivezic: there is a great introduction to the book by having their Cvs. That i'll show you in in in a few slides. It basically gives you very, very

28
01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:27.890
Zeljko Ivezic: a non-technical, gentle introduction to the concept of a asian statistics. What is the difference compared to regular statistics?

29
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:44.600
Zeljko Ivezic: And it's? It's very good. Read you can read it 1 h and coffee bar, so I don't know if it's available in Zag bookstores. But definitely you can get it on on Amazon or any other website. It's a tiny, tiny book, but it's it's an amazing book, so I highly recommend it.

30
01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:54.090
Zeljko Ivezic: Today i'll talk a little bit about how do we take by a base rule that we already introduced. It is just

31
01:25:54.170 --> 01:26:02.250
Zeljko Ivezic: simple result of probability considerations that we did in our first class. When we stated this role.

32
01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:08.320
Zeljko Ivezic: Today we will extend its meaning to probability theory to inference.

33
01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:17.720
Zeljko Ivezic: and then we'll talk a little bit about the priors that modify likelihoods to get posterior in this context. And then it starts doing some practical examples.

34
01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:19.990
Zeljko Ivezic: and we'll finish with

35
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:26.250
Zeljko Ivezic: discussion of nuisance, parameters and marginalization, which are key concerts. And by

36
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.760
Zeljko Ivezic: there's an approach to data modeling. It's all about the

37
01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:46.660
Zeljko Ivezic: and then we'll continue for the remaining lectures. Next time we will show slightly more complicated examples, and we'll talk about model probabilities, a concept that does not exist in classical statistics. And then

38
01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:56.040
Zeljko Ivezic: we'll have a little break, because I have to travel, and the last 2 lectures will be then heavy duty by Asian approach to data modeling. When we will introduce

39
01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:01.850
Zeljko Ivezic: to Markov Chain, Monte Carlo and some tools that are

40
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:18.890
Zeljko Ivezic: use to do professional level data analysis. So this I call it from that little beautiful book by breaking their Syria is a lectured at Oxford University, British physicist with Indian background.

41
01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:25.890
Zeljko Ivezic: So I open the book, and they start to reading this and read it yourself. This first photograph is just

42
01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:30.500
Zeljko Ivezic: so many people.

43
01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:39.210
Zeljko Ivezic: So you take statistics.

44
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:51.530
Zeljko Ivezic: you, you 3 yellow balls and 7 red balls, you know. jar, and then what is the probability of it? And it don't make sense.

45
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:59.570
Zeljko Ivezic: But then, somehow, magically when you start integrating data, real day time, the scientific context, when you have to.

46
01:27:59.930 --> 01:28:13.750
Zeljko Ivezic: when you have to fix some function for your data or you have to do some hypotheses testing when you ask questions like, Did my sample really come from?

47
01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:23.670
Zeljko Ivezic: Then you have this series on different statistical tests. hundreds and thousands of pets and open it some clear. But

48
01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:28.470
Zeljko Ivezic: what do you have to use? Then you go, and you find a

49
01:28:28.530 --> 01:28:39.310
Zeljko Ivezic: they tell you. Oh, you should use this. And you ask why, Don't, that it's not intellectually very satisfying approach to what you're doing.

50
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:43.780
Zeljko Ivezic: Probability that makes much more sense. But input, is statistic

51
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:54.430
Zeljko Ivezic: statistics that not relied on on probability as much as by as the on statistics. And you'll see that it's exactly the application of probability to

52
01:28:54.520 --> 01:29:05.450
Zeljko Ivezic: interpret our measurements. So that's basically the the only form you want, the Of course it's like

53
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:17.780
Zeljko Ivezic: itation for simple age. But then there is whole physics built on it. You need to know what it means. So this for me also looks very. But starting with this for me.

54
01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:30.080
Zeljko Ivezic: we do write the entire framework for the so it says so. These are conditional probabilities, it says the probability of, and whatever M is in our context, it's model.

55
01:29:30.210 --> 01:29:34.130
Zeljko Ivezic: Given this vertical part, you can give us some of the impact

56
01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:41.390
Zeljko Ivezic: is equal to probability of data. Given some model. That's what we call likelihood last time.

57
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:46.420
Zeljko Ivezic: And now we have 2 more terms together, probability of.

58
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:50.210
Zeljko Ivezic: and it's divided by probability of data which is

59
01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:55.960
Zeljko Ivezic: later, we will see simply integral of the numerator. Now, where does it come from?

60
01:29:56.840 --> 01:30:02.680
Zeljko Ivezic: It's not magic. It's just simple claim probability that we use the first selection.

61
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:14.130
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you remember, we set the probability of 2 events X and Y happening together can be expressed using conditional probability.

62
01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:16.770
Zeljko Ivezic: If I want to know

63
01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:23.220
Zeljko Ivezic: what is probability of 2 events, then it is probability one of them

64
01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:27.850
Zeljko Ivezic: happening. If we know that the other one happens.

65
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:31.150
Zeljko Ivezic: finds the probability of the other one.

66
01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:35.880
Zeljko Ivezic: So what is the probability that I will have

67
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:39.760
Zeljko Ivezic: umbrella, and that it's raining outside.

68
01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:48.500
Zeljko Ivezic: that probability is equal to probability that I take my umbrella if it is rating outside.

69
01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:59.670
Zeljko Ivezic: And so, for example, people from Seattle don't take umbrellas because they don't care about train, but in Zag that you can see lots of people. So there is some range of.

70
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:11.580
Zeljko Ivezic: and then the second term is probability that it will be running irrespective of me taking a regular account. So P. Of x is probability that it's raining.

71
01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:19.070
Zeljko Ivezic: P. Of Y. Given x is the probability I will red umbrella if it is raining.

72
01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:25.680
Zeljko Ivezic: and that gives it the ability to that. It's both raining the outside and at that micro.

73
01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:34.740
Zeljko Ivezic: So it's conceptually quite simple. comes directly from the This is called base rule, and so far, because nothing

74
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:43.840
Zeljko Ivezic: to do this, they kind of interpretation. I don't want to do this statistics. It's not controversial. It's just plain probability derived.

75
01:31:43.930 --> 01:31:45.600
Zeljko Ivezic: Svd. First lecture on.

76
01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:58.840
Zeljko Ivezic: But interesting thing happens when we now applied to models data and model for.

77
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:02.520
Zeljko Ivezic: So

78
01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:06.180
Zeljko Ivezic: that's the same form, and I had a big slide.

79
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:11.840
Zeljko Ivezic: the one in the middle P. Or why given X is simply the ratio of the 2.

80
01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:19.920
Zeljko Ivezic: And now you can see that from the law of total probability, P. Of X. Can also be expressed

81
01:32:20.170 --> 01:32:30.620
Zeljko Ivezic: as interground over conditional probability. X. Even one times B of Y, and you integrate all that while. and by definition

82
01:32:31.610 --> 01:32:47.010
Zeljko Ivezic: this is now probability distribution, the one on the left by given X, because if you are now integrated. Numerator: so it is by definition one. It integrates one. It's the it's proper

83
01:32:47.150 --> 01:32:49.650
Zeljko Ivezic: probability density function.

84
01:32:51.170 --> 01:32:56.640
Zeljko Ivezic: So how how does that apply now to statistics and data interpretation

85
01:32:57.130 --> 01:33:05.000
Zeljko Ivezic: in classical. It's for frequency services that we learn from kindergarten there. The assumption is.

86
01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:12.660
Zeljko Ivezic: you do many hypothetical experiments that are just like your experiment

87
01:33:12.930 --> 01:33:17.950
Zeljko Ivezic: from your experiment. you you arrive

88
01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:33.490
Zeljko Ivezic: probability or frequency distribution for those future experiments. So if you derive some model parameter and you put confidence inter of it. Then you say, if I say 68% around my meeting value.

89
01:33:33.630 --> 01:33:37.750
that means that I now, if I now started

90
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:39.580
Zeljko Ivezic: repeating this experiment

91
01:33:40.850 --> 01:33:51.720
Zeljko Ivezic: in 68. Of those experiments I will get confidence in the they are true value would be within that literally. It would contain the

92
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:52.700
Zeljko Ivezic: and

93
01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:55.660
Zeljko Ivezic: 32% of the experiments

94
01:33:55.750 --> 01:34:02.880
Zeljko Ivezic: because of random statistical fluctuations, would have true value outside of that internal.

95
01:34:04.210 --> 01:34:08.180
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's all fine, and you get the right answer to this.

96
01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:11.920
Zeljko Ivezic: But in practice in science this is not a question we are asking

97
01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:17.040
Zeljko Ivezic: in science. What we are asking is, I have my data set.

98
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:29.260
Zeljko Ivezic: I don't want to think about future data. What I want to ask is, I have my data set. I'm trying to estimate a model parameter or more. I want to know

99
01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:34.680
Zeljko Ivezic: the interval in which I can say with 68% confidence.

100
01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:43.250
Zeljko Ivezic: I want to know that I am bracketing. So it's different question, very similar to different.

101
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:48.520
Zeljko Ivezic: and that question is answered by the

102
01:34:48.650 --> 01:34:51.050
Zeljko Ivezic: expression, the

103
01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:54.020
Zeljko Ivezic: so it will be slightly

104
01:34:55.010 --> 01:35:02.400
Zeljko Ivezic: clearer. Once we start looking at the actual examples. But this page summarizes this difference in philosophy.

105
01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:04.720
Zeljko Ivezic: so it is not that one.

106
01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:16.050
Zeljko Ivezic: The approach is right and the other one is wrong. If you take literature from eighties or nineties. When Bayesian statistics started coming back.

107
01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:20.150
Zeljko Ivezic: It was correlated with the advent of computers later to see that

108
01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:39.770
Zeljko Ivezic: if you want to solve real life problems, there are lots of multi-dimensional. you know, hard to solve integrals, and that's why there were 2 centuries between the advent of by using a statistics by Laplace and actual adoption of by a. C. And statistics by people doing quantitative science.

109
01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:46.100
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you read that literature from eighties and nineteenth, there are a lot of arguments who is right, who is wrong?

110
01:35:46.590 --> 01:36:01.480
Zeljko Ivezic: There was that came of well established professors who were trained in frequent with statistics. and they were saying, that's how you do it, starting with Fisher from the early twentieth century. And then there was this new cohort of much younger people.

111
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:04.790
Zeljko Ivezic: who, where it's for the group. Younger people. Usually

112
01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:09.330
Zeljko Ivezic: I easier. It's adopting new ideas Once you're all, Professor, then you're kind of

113
01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:23.470
Zeljko Ivezic: very hard to get something in your scout. But young people, they are not married to this framework. So they were looking at this reasoning logically. They conclude this is the way to go, and we can actually do it, because now we have computers.

114
01:36:23.470 --> 01:36:41.370
Zeljko Ivezic: But conceptually it took decades to to realize that it's not that someone is wrong. Someone is right. It's that different questions are asked, and the questions that we are actually asking in science as well. In other contexts, where, by using a statistics is applied.

115
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:54.750
Zeljko Ivezic: the question we are asking is answered by like credible region rather than those confidence limits that you get to pre goodness statistics. So maybe this sounds a little bit like reaching.

116
01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:03.740
Zeljko Ivezic: but we will get to point where, from numerical examples it will click hopefully, and and you will understand what is the difference.

117
01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:32.130
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is now similar slides in the same formula as before. But, as I said, trading, your equation sounds, citizen, when you look at it. But then, when you start writing out operators that it can become a little bit more complicated. But you are also then having powerful tool, explain it. So if you look now in this formula, it's again. P. Of M. Given D. Is equal to P. Of D. Given, and Times, P. Of N. That divided by the of

118
01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:37.650
Zeljko Ivezic: what I edit now is next to, and I edit, theta

119
01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:41.720
Zeljko Ivezic: and at the end of each I edit on.

120
01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:49.030
Zeljko Ivezic: So now I expand it to the meeting of this siblings so, and as itself is a model.

121
01:37:49.410 --> 01:37:54.400
Zeljko Ivezic: and that model is described by a vector of free parameters data.

122
01:37:54.730 --> 01:38:01.440
Zeljko Ivezic: Like if i'm fitting straight line, I have 2 parameters, a and B, or K. And L, or whatever you want to call it.

123
01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:04.290
Zeljko Ivezic: But in practice you can have any parameters. So

124
01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:07.590
Zeljko Ivezic: vector theta

125
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:09.480
Zeljko Ivezic: and so now i'm saying

126
01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:14.510
Zeljko Ivezic: probability of my model and all the parameters that describe.

127
01:38:15.530 --> 01:38:28.720
Zeljko Ivezic: They are describing this model, given some data set. and I for private information. So whenever you measure something. It never happens that we are.

128
01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:40.590
Zeljko Ivezic: There is always at least some prior information like. For example, if I wanted to measure for whatever of one of you.

129
01:38:41.330 --> 01:38:42.670
Zeljko Ivezic: I already know.

130
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:48.400
Zeljko Ivezic: from my prior knowledge of physics, that that number must be positive there is no I got to wait.

131
01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:51.160
Zeljko Ivezic: and I want some how to

132
01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:58.230
Zeljko Ivezic: introduce that piece of information from my hands. If I measure it something else, like if I, measuring

133
01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:02.830
Zeljko Ivezic: voltage and outlet, then it can be both positive and negative.

134
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:16.830
Zeljko Ivezic: but I know it's 100 milliondollars I don't need to measure. I get to here to know that the results cannot be more so we always have some prior information that we can work into our analysis.

135
01:39:16.890 --> 01:39:27.410
Zeljko Ivezic: so that I, for all the information we will see later how to explicitly account for. And now on the right hand side, that P. Of the

136
01:39:27.490 --> 01:39:29.680
Zeljko Ivezic: given some model.

137
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:41.910
Zeljko Ivezic: and in each case that's the 3 parameters. So this first term is likelihood that we introduced last time.

138
01:39:43.130 --> 01:39:54.720
Zeljko Ivezic: So I have some data. Maybe I measured a bunch of X that is like we already discussed. And then I say, if I assume that it's really

139
01:39:55.130 --> 01:40:06.270
Zeljko Ivezic: and if I now adopt some model parameters, say Mu and Sigma. what is the probability? What is the likelihood that I would measure this value.

140
01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:10.430
Zeljko Ivezic: and, like we discussed last time. Let's say, if you think of

141
01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:14.500
Zeljko Ivezic: 100 is new, Sigma is 15.

142
01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:21.040
Zeljko Ivezic: It is very, very, very unlikely that she would measure IP of 500.

143
01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:33.100
Zeljko Ivezic: That would be like 1020 in my way. You would need to have, i'm guessing now. Billions and billions, billions of people to have one person who would be

144
01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:40.970
Zeljko Ivezic: fewer than 10 billionpeople on her. So I can immediately say that the not one

145
01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:52.920
Zeljko Ivezic: but I go and scan over all these values, and I can compute like once I adopt more than once I understand. How are my measurements generated?

146
01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:58.330
Zeljko Ivezic: What am I, which distribution I'm drawing in from then I can write my

147
01:40:59.450 --> 01:41:07.240
Zeljko Ivezic: And now, in addition to that likelihood, so last time we would maximize likelihood to get the best model for us.

148
01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:12.290
Zeljko Ivezic: But now this shows that this story is more complicated. It's not just the

149
01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:19.590
Zeljko Ivezic: there is a term for try or model capability and prior probability of those parameters.

150
01:41:20.230 --> 01:41:23.420
Zeljko Ivezic: and it's slightly off. Oh, okay.

151
01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:28.540
there is I at the end to, and there is this point.

152
01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:39.220
Zeljko Ivezic: So this prior, this is everything we know about this model and this and again. Now you can think of it as 2 events, and and theta

153
01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:47.330
Zeljko Ivezic: you can again express it as conditional probability. So the first term is, if I tell you, it's Gaussian.

154
01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:51.680
then what is the probability of.

155
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:58.020
Zeljko Ivezic: and then probability that it really is. Now I can tell you, if it is distribution.

156
01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:18.240
Zeljko Ivezic: and if it is good sheet distribution, what is the probability of parameters for machine distribution times? The probability of that, I can tell you. I'm 90% confident it's Gaussian. But there is 10% probabilities for sheet, and then it would go over what sets of models, and we'll actually do that numerically next time.

157
01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:22.770
Zeljko Ivezic: So this right hand side in the numerator. That's the key.

158
01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:28.780
Zeljko Ivezic: It is not just the likelihood you need to multiply by the prior for modeling this paramet.

159
01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:39.420
Zeljko Ivezic: and because the expression on the left is proper probability that the distribution we know it has to integrate to one.

160
01:42:39.690 --> 01:42:43.640
Zeljko Ivezic: So this P. Of the given I probability of data.

161
01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:55.910
Zeljko Ivezic: In most cases you don't really care about it. You don't seem to evaluate it. You just 3 normalize the numerator, so that when you integrate it it will give you one

162
01:42:56.750 --> 01:43:01.540
Zeljko Ivezic: only when we care about the probability of model itself.

163
01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:15.750
Zeljko Ivezic: Then we will need to look here for that, and we'll address it next time. So that's basically the the the gist of application of base rule to statistics. So we extend

164
01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:18.760
Zeljko Ivezic: likelihood by multiplying it by prior

165
01:43:20.150 --> 01:43:25.700
Zeljko Ivezic: and just to remind you from the last time this is copy and based from the last time.

166
01:43:26.730 --> 01:43:37.090
Zeljko Ivezic: So we had Gaussian distribution. We had n measurements, X, I. And they were. which then we got a certain things for each measurement. Sigma I.

167
01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:50.770
Zeljko Ivezic: And the underlying assumption is, if you are measuring some well-defined quantity, same mass of a planet, or a point of some rod or this table, or whatever energy or something.

168
01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:54.740
Zeljko Ivezic: and our measurements are scheduled around that value. Mu.

169
01:43:55.290 --> 01:44:01.450
Zeljko Ivezic: According to this, Sigma, and we are asking what is our best estimate of that may be.

170
01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:03.680
Zeljko Ivezic: and Sigma on

171
01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:16.040
Zeljko Ivezic: was constant, then it would be simply the main value. You add up all your measurements to by the number of events in your because here we have different uncertainties for each measurement.

172
01:44:16.130 --> 01:44:18.860
Zeljko Ivezic: the result is weighted. Some.

173
01:44:19.330 --> 01:44:28.740
Zeljko Ivezic: So we write that likelihood we take derivative with respect to you, and we find maximum likelihood value, and the last expression for me. Not

174
01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:32.410
Zeljko Ivezic: that it shows you the results it's. Basically

175
01:44:32.930 --> 01:44:45.730
Zeljko Ivezic: and in Ghana all the measurements, but they each carry weight which is inversely proportional to Sigma on its own again. It's Sigma eyes are the same. They don't cancel in that expression. You get formula for the mean value.

176
01:44:46.210 --> 01:44:53.560
Zeljko Ivezic: but if they are not the same, then you have to wait according to precision of each measurement. and the following is also

177
01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:59.580
Zeljko Ivezic: copy and paste from the last time. So we we generated 3 measurements.

178
01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:07.450
Zeljko Ivezic: and they gave us 3 likelihood, these colored lines, red, green, and blue.

179
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:10.310
Zeljko Ivezic: And when I do this.

180
01:45:10.770 --> 01:45:15.000
Zeljko Ivezic: what i'm doing is, I take, I take this position, base it.

181
01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:33.200
Zeljko Ivezic: The narrower is the line, the more weight I get. Then I take this position. I get that position and my end result is given by black line. So in this figure, what I did was to multiply these 3 lines to get a black line, and that just be normalizing. So

182
01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:37.460
Zeljko Ivezic: the integr with one. But if I just focus on the peak.

183
01:45:37.630 --> 01:45:39.540
that's what this formula gives you

184
01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:52.990
Zeljko Ivezic: this new, not it's the position of the peak of the Black line. and then Xi's. Are p. Of the each of the 3 colored lines, and they are weighted by the sigmas.

185
01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:58.430
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's how I get the final 2 ways to do it.

186
01:45:58.810 --> 01:46:00.710
This is just using probability.

187
01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:11.830
Zeljko Ivezic: Now this is maximum lining with the approach that we find. Wait it some. And as a result of these 3 measurements, this is the best we can do in estimating me.

188
01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:20.220
Zeljko Ivezic: But now, what by, as an approach, allows us to do is to add additional information. And so here, what if I told you

189
01:46:20.410 --> 01:46:39.200
Zeljko Ivezic: that new less than point 9 is through out by something else. Either it's not physical, or someone else from some other measurements, or it's like this thing is great. They can be only positive, etc., etc. Often we have some other constraints

190
01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:53.030
Zeljko Ivezic: and the frequent statistics it is basically hand waiting how to add additional constraints to your measurements. But in this context, then, we interpret our measurements. As for ability distributions, it's trivial.

191
01:46:53.630 --> 01:46:58.320
Zeljko Ivezic: I just cut off everything less than point 9 what it is

192
01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:06.850
Zeljko Ivezic: 0, and then I need to renormalize these ones to again integrate to one, but they are completely valid.

193
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:10.910
Zeljko Ivezic: That also, for example, this example is related

194
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:26.850
Zeljko Ivezic: when when you have small number, statistics, and you say my. so you say I measured 4, but my certainty square root of 4 is 2. So 2 Sigma deviation is 0,

195
01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:33.680
Zeljko Ivezic: 3 sigma variation would be minus 2. So 4 minus 3 times 2 is minus 2.

196
01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:43.080
Zeljko Ivezic: That's approach or frequency statistics. But often when we measure something and counts cannot be negative down. And so what do you do then? How do you treat

197
01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:44.650
Zeljko Ivezic: get results?

198
01:47:45.150 --> 01:47:50.310
Zeljko Ivezic: There is no value to answer in frequency statistics. But here it is

199
01:47:51.070 --> 01:47:55.040
Zeljko Ivezic: basically just cut off by your external constraint.

200
01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:07.580
Zeljko Ivezic: So where is that all coming from? I've been there already to a little bit of history. So there was a weather, and Thomas Base, who lived about. Is it now? 300 years ago?

201
01:48:07.970 --> 01:48:13.080
Zeljko Ivezic: Almost. he was asked for mathematician. He was

202
01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:15.580
Zeljko Ivezic: trying to answer

203
01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:26.990
Zeljko Ivezic: question, how do you combine multiple measurements? So let's say we measure something and time. Let's take simple example that has all the same errors.

204
01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:40.790
Zeljko Ivezic: So when you want to get mean value, your best overall results. You add up all the measurements and divide by the number of measurements, and that you assume mean value. That's your current test estimate.

205
01:48:41.050 --> 01:48:43.740
Zeljko Ivezic: Now it's so. You have another measurement.

206
01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:59.400
Zeljko Ivezic: Do you now need to recompute me for everything. or can I take just the value of previous me. and somehow combine it with a new measurement to get an updated value of you.

207
01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:01.830
Zeljko Ivezic: This is the simplest possible example.

208
01:49:02.630 --> 01:49:12.840
Zeljko Ivezic: So we know that it mean you can just split the formula, and we show that somewhere this is slightly more complicated example that has different. But the first one said.

209
01:49:13.090 --> 01:49:29.050
Zeljko Ivezic: After I have any measurements. I take all my measurements, and I do wait it some. Now I can do this formula and say what's what happened? If I did get one measurement to go when I had only end models one.

210
01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:38.120
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's the formula before, since we will just replace and but my mind is one, and that's it. So this formula now

211
01:49:38.230 --> 01:49:48.480
Zeljko Ivezic: I can expand the one with end measurements into 2 terms: one that looks just like n minus one case, and then I have

212
01:49:48.910 --> 01:50:06.350
Zeljko Ivezic: a correction term due to the latest measurement. So this down to you how to combine your measurements. If I have a new measurement, you don't have to be. Compute everything. You just properly wait that all results plus new measurement to get updated value of me.

213
01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:16.810
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is fairly simple, or possibly the simplest possible example, maybe not the same as the one in the bottom as simple as possible, because it has

214
01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:23.740
Zeljko Ivezic: equal weights. So if I had n minus one measurements, and that was my mean value.

215
01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:39.080
Zeljko Ivezic: and I got the 8 measurements. Then my update is value is the sum of 2 terms. The old measurement is weighted by N. Minus one over N, which is close to one, and this one on this new measurement gets weight, one over n

216
01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:42.510
Zeljko Ivezic: so intuitively that's the right thing to do.

217
01:50:43.410 --> 01:50:47.380
Zeljko Ivezic: And sometimes this is called online computation.

218
01:50:47.410 --> 01:50:56.190
Zeljko Ivezic: Basically I If I had an millions of measurements, and the only thing i'm interested is being valuable. I do not have to remember those 1 million measurements

219
01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:08.160
Zeljko Ivezic: in my computer. For example, if I don't have enough memory, it's enough to remember what was the mean value, and how many data points it was based on. I only need to remember 2 numbers, not a 1 million numbers.

220
01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:12.650
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's sometimes important. So this is simple

221
01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:17.250
Zeljko Ivezic: approach that we can do in our head or it algebra.

222
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:28.690
Zeljko Ivezic: But the same principle applies to everything we measure, even when we measure thousands or millions quantities, and then we measure much more complicated probability distribution.

223
01:51:28.850 --> 01:51:31.810
Zeljko Ivezic: It's exactly the same approach.

224
01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:41.020
Zeljko Ivezic: And so basically this diagram summarizes this. This is what we had

225
01:51:41.770 --> 01:51:57.390
Zeljko Ivezic: the last time. Again we talked about 2 measurements. and we combine them the top weighted measurement. It's exactly the same math and everything. When you apply it to

226
01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:04.910
Zeljko Ivezic: who by a context just different meaning. So now, again, I have 2 probabilities.

227
01:52:05.050 --> 01:52:10.970
Zeljko Ivezic: The like one is likelihood. I measure this.

228
01:52:11.010 --> 01:52:17.150
Zeljko Ivezic: if I didn't do by as this, I would say, this is my likelihood I can find this maximum.

229
01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:22.160
Zeljko Ivezic: and the best value of underlying review is the peak of that pipeline.

230
01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:33.010
Zeljko Ivezic: But in context, I say, wait a minute. This is not the only thing right now. I also know something from prior to the measurements or whatever.

231
01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:38.320
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's my red line. Before I did any measurement I thought you would be.

232
01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:41.020
Zeljko Ivezic: Is it 1.2 or whatever? Some number?

233
01:52:41.130 --> 01:52:48.980
Zeljko Ivezic: And I had a larger uncertainty. That's what I thought I would have before the measurement, and then I get my measurement.

234
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:50.250
Zeljko Ivezic: Black

235
01:52:51.240 --> 01:53:07.410
Zeljko Ivezic: right could be either some theoretical knowledge, or it could be the actual measurement, either previous measurement by the same method it could be even different methods for measuring it doesn't matter. It summarizes our knowledge of everything prior to the new measurement.

236
01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:08.570
Zeljko Ivezic: We think

237
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:16.660
Zeljko Ivezic: this is the value, and we are confident in this interval. And so now I multiply by like, input and the result is

238
01:53:16.860 --> 01:53:18.060
Zeljko Ivezic: green mine.

239
01:53:18.910 --> 01:53:21.510
That's my posterior.

240
01:53:22.410 --> 01:53:33.420
Zeljko Ivezic: So, because they are just probabilities, I multiply them. And now, given my prior knowledge and given my new measurements in black line our best knowledge

241
01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:37.490
with those 2 pieces of information.

242
01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:51.610
Zeljko Ivezic: And so you can see the green line is now lower than neither of these 2, because I combined 2 pieces of information. If you look at the weight of black and the bit of green, it's hard to tell with your eye, which one is

243
01:53:51.690 --> 01:53:59.160
Zeljko Ivezic: wider. But look at the fight. Green is higher than black, since they have to integrate one.

244
01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:03.860
Zeljko Ivezic: then obviously test will be slightly more than the black one.

245
01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:20.560
Zeljko Ivezic: So our knowledge improved our knowledge as summarized by uncertainty by the width of that probability distribution improved. And now you can imagine that I take my green line to be new product.

246
01:54:20.670 --> 01:54:24.240
Zeljko Ivezic: What are you paying anything right? There is no new measurement

247
01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:31.130
Zeljko Ivezic: plan which will be scheduled around here. I multiply the 2, and I get updated value of my exterior.

248
01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:42.340
Zeljko Ivezic: and each time a new measurement that posterior goes narrow and error and error, as if I would have infinite number of measurements that the stereo would become direct. Still.

249
01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:48.400
Zeljko Ivezic: So I update my measurements through this process. That's basically what.

250
01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:51.840
Zeljko Ivezic: how far from us base.

251
01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:57.120
Zeljko Ivezic: And it was not yet for fun, and he even died before we published that. Yes

252
01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:09.140
Zeljko Ivezic: or everything. The process where I have likelihood I mounted by my prior knowledge

253
01:55:09.150 --> 01:55:13.840
Zeljko Ivezic: we normalize to integrate to one this is my posterior. It worked for everything

254
01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:20.220
Zeljko Ivezic: in any dimension, then it

255
01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:34.050
Zeljko Ivezic: so. Then he had some friends who like him. So he They published his papers 2 years after they passed away. and then nothing can happen much. It was forgotten.

256
01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:40.920
Zeljko Ivezic: And then the famous scientist, Pierre Laplace will, you know, from many contexts, including the last.

257
01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:44.880
Zeljko Ivezic: He rediscovered basically the whole thing.

258
01:55:45.050 --> 01:56:01.010
Zeljko Ivezic: and as he was working on it he he found out about the work by Thomas Base. and then the name he gave it by Asian approach. But really it should be called Laplacian statistics, because the guy who really meant it.

259
01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:04.570
Zeljko Ivezic: and it showed in a much simpler way what to do.

260
01:56:04.610 --> 01:56:08.870
Zeljko Ivezic: and connected it to the probability theory it was.

261
01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:11.200
Zeljko Ivezic: But that's history, what we can do

262
01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:17.590
Zeljko Ivezic: so. He what he became famous by when he was trying to

263
01:56:17.710 --> 01:56:28.050
Zeljko Ivezic: ascertain the confidence region for the measurements of the mass of subtle at the time at that time, because possibly that

264
01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:33.370
Zeljko Ivezic: certainly wasn't moving in its orbit.

265
01:56:33.850 --> 01:56:38.180
Zeljko Ivezic: according to Kepler's loss, something was missing in the model.

266
01:56:38.650 --> 01:56:44.840
Zeljko Ivezic: And actually this was led to the discovery of Uranus by.

267
01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:57.470
Zeljko Ivezic: So there are deviations from the expected traditional force, and that was due to another plan that they didn't know about. But prior to that. The big question was, what is actually mass of Sutton.

268
01:56:57.820 --> 01:57:04.120
Zeljko Ivezic: And so that's when in the problem. That's when he was the first one to say it

269
01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:13.000
Zeljko Ivezic: the theability region in terms of a bet. You said, I find that it's a bet of 11,000 against one.

270
01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:16.150
Zeljko Ivezic: that the error of this result is not one

271
01:57:16.230 --> 01:57:22.980
Zeljko Ivezic: a 100 of its value, so it's a very weird way of stating. But you can easily now

272
01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:34.430
Zeljko Ivezic: take this information. Look at Gaussian distribution, and then you can calculate what Sigma, it is actually in plan, and what percentage error that.

273
01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:40.720
Zeljko Ivezic: But again, because subtle, is only one, the frequent is interpretation obviously

274
01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:51.420
Zeljko Ivezic: is not right. We cannot now imagine that we have many seconds. There is one, and what we want to know is what is the range of allowed masses at that time. Given that as measurement.

275
01:57:53.260 --> 01:58:05.710
Zeljko Ivezic: And another example is what we already talked about last time as a video by using the approach. So there is usually, if you take flat prior, and we'll talk about progress in a moment more.

276
01:58:08.420 --> 01:58:11.650
Zeljko Ivezic: If you take pled priors often

277
01:58:11.730 --> 01:58:20.680
Zeljko Ivezic: with by Asian approach or posterior probability distribution, you get identical results numerically to what you would get from maximum like.

278
01:58:21.170 --> 01:58:28.760
Zeljko Ivezic: In cases where where you have simple. simple model.

279
01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:35.740
Zeljko Ivezic: However, this waiting for bus problem is very, very juvenil, because you get drastically.

280
01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:40.800
Zeljko Ivezic: So to remind you, we are waiting for bus

281
01:58:40.820 --> 01:58:42.960
Zeljko Ivezic: 40 min

282
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:48.620
Zeljko Ivezic: bus arrives. The only thing we know is that bus runs regularly

283
01:58:48.750 --> 01:58:55.180
Zeljko Ivezic: with spacing of tower minutes. and we waited 10 min and bus arrived.

284
01:58:55.520 --> 01:59:00.330
Zeljko Ivezic: What can we tell about Cloud? How often to

285
01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:15.020
Zeljko Ivezic: and so that points in time when we often the bus is no special in any way. So we assume it is uniform distribution, and on average, the bus will the right, and be waiting for half of that inter

286
01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:24.590
Zeljko Ivezic: by reason of symmetry. It's very unlikely that bus would arrive 1 s after we arrived at the station, or that you would have to wait until

287
01:59:24.930 --> 01:59:30.010
Zeljko Ivezic: Tau minus second, because we just missed that. Typically, it would wait

288
01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:32.010
Zeljko Ivezic: about top of this stuff.

289
01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:35.600
Zeljko Ivezic: That's what we, what common sense is telling us.

290
01:59:35.730 --> 01:59:42.440
Zeljko Ivezic: but maximum. Not that town is

291
01:59:46.630 --> 01:59:48.160
Zeljko Ivezic: factor of 2 different.

292
01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:50.730
Zeljko Ivezic: And so this is not.

293
01:59:52.980 --> 02:00:06.410
Zeljko Ivezic: This is not some measurement where we maybe wouldn't care for factor of 2. This is fundamental. But why do we have that? Why does common sense not agree with

294
02:00:06.540 --> 02:00:08.320
Zeljko Ivezic: that? Some likely solution.

295
02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:21.460
Zeljko Ivezic: and there is a solution of that puzzle. Is that maximum likelihood is not complete. You have to do it in a full probabilistic framework. In other words, you have to multiply that likelihood by Prior.

296
02:00:22.090 --> 02:00:28.450
Zeljko Ivezic: And so we first talk a little bit about how do we set products? And then we solve the problem on the.

297
02:00:29.370 --> 02:00:32.060
Zeljko Ivezic: So again, to summarize this first part.

298
02:00:33.270 --> 02:00:36.740
Zeljko Ivezic: so base rule comes from probability.

299
02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:40.500
Zeljko Ivezic: then we use it to

300
02:00:41.050 --> 02:00:48.800
Zeljko Ivezic: in the context of model selection and model parameter estimation in the context of the analysis.

301
02:00:48.890 --> 02:00:58.820
Zeljko Ivezic: and then it becomes so. The steps are just as it likelihood you have to understand

302
02:00:58.890 --> 02:01:04.050
Zeljko Ivezic: what your measurements do, how they are generated as to know how right like.

303
02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:22.230
Zeljko Ivezic: Often this is just a Gaussian distribution in many measurements as a result of is some, and you have, and you have some certainty that somehow you estimate it.

304
02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:29.450
Zeljko Ivezic: It's in the majority of it. Sometimes it's different distribution, or sometimes it's binomial distribution. But Sonia, etc.,

305
02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:32.890
Zeljko Ivezic: many of them in the limits of large number of measurements.

306
02:01:33.050 --> 02:01:37.280
Zeljko Ivezic: More

307
02:01:37.530 --> 02:01:39.990
Zeljko Ivezic: so you, the formal, is that what?

308
02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:43.210
Zeljko Ivezic: And then you have to choose a product.

309
02:01:43.390 --> 02:01:54.160
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's where a lot of physics, philosophical discussion and arguments happened in the eighties and nineties of the last such century. Because, when you say, choose prior

310
02:01:54.840 --> 02:02:03.000
Zeljko Ivezic: and people that are all up in on. But science is objective. We cannot choose science subjective. Everyone has to have the same result.

311
02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:05.600
Zeljko Ivezic: And so it took a few decades to to

312
02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:10.890
Zeljko Ivezic: realize that you cannot have the same results. If you have different

313
02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:12.530
Zeljko Ivezic: prior to the information.

314
02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:17.570
Zeljko Ivezic: if you like this.

315
02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:24.670
Zeljko Ivezic: if someone else use the same measurement. But didn't know that that information

316
02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:29.250
Zeljko Ivezic: there is a I about doing the time I don't want to get.

317
02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:32.470
Zeljko Ivezic: There is a famous example of a game.

318
02:02:34.430 --> 02:02:42.360
Zeljko Ivezic: You have $3, and you have price behind the on board. and the other 2 doors. Don't have anything.

319
02:02:42.690 --> 02:02:47.780
Zeljko Ivezic: And now there is Guy who is initial host, and you are.

320
02:02:47.970 --> 02:02:56.470
Zeljko Ivezic: You are guest, and now you choose one door. and so you choose that door. and then the host.

321
02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:02.250
Zeljko Ivezic: we will open one of the remaining 2 doors that doesn't have a price.

322
02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:10.570
Zeljko Ivezic: So let's say to this door, I have this 2, and I open the middle one, and it's something.

323
02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:20.010
Zeljko Ivezic: and the question is, should you now switch from this door to that door to increase your chances of the award?

324
02:03:20.050 --> 02:03:26.720
Zeljko Ivezic: Or should you stick to it? Would the probability increase if you now use this

325
02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:27.840
information?

326
02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:32.310
And I don't want now to spend 15 min discussing the

327
02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:36.500
Zeljko Ivezic: but if you look it up in that. If you have access to the textbook

328
02:03:36.570 --> 02:03:46.320
Zeljko Ivezic: it you can find the conditional probability approach to this problem, and you get the results that many people find counter into it.

329
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:55.320
Zeljko Ivezic: When you look at the 3 doors, then when you think about thousands doors, then you realize oh, i'm stupid, of course, blah blah blah! I don't want to tell you the final.

330
02:03:55.950 --> 02:03:58.400
Zeljko Ivezic: but because of 3 doors it's very confusing.

331
02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:07.910
Zeljko Ivezic: So you have to choose. Prior. This shows and a good discussion. Why did I mention this example? You who know

332
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:11.060
Zeljko Ivezic: that you picked this door

333
02:04:11.090 --> 02:04:15.430
Zeljko Ivezic: and then post open this door, and now you have to make decision.

334
02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:22.050
Zeljko Ivezic: Your decision is statistically different. Then, if someone else then walked in the room.

335
02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:27.120
Zeljko Ivezic: looked at these doors. Obviously this one is open

336
02:04:28.370 --> 02:04:35.700
Zeljko Ivezic: and it's anything, and there are 2 closed doors. That person would conclude differently if they

337
02:04:36.290 --> 02:04:46.410
Zeljko Ivezic: it didn't know that that door was fixed at the beginning. That person would think this is one of the 3 doors that was open and empty.

338
02:04:46.550 --> 02:05:05.460
Zeljko Ivezic: But the guy who was in the room the first contestant knows that actually it was one of the 2 doors that was open, and that makes the difference. And that's case of different prior information. The guy who started the game is now different prior information that the guy could just walk to the

339
02:05:05.580 --> 02:05:16.620
Zeljko Ivezic: and that translates to to other to other cases. So choosing a prior is not something. Yeah, it's not subjective. It doesn't make you bad signs.

340
02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:22.320
Zeljko Ivezic: Yeah. And if you have product measurements that's in.

341
02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:25.480
Zeljko Ivezic: If I said that I've mentioned before this.

342
02:05:25.690 --> 02:05:31.130
Zeljko Ivezic: and the result is that this is expected to.

343
02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:35.880
Zeljko Ivezic: But there are also

344
02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:49.720
Zeljko Ivezic: about. There are no all measurements, but you can still involve symmetries in your problem that will tell you what to choose, so we'll get there in a second. So once you have like people, once you get prior.

345
02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:51.590
Zeljko Ivezic: he's a

346
02:05:51.670 --> 02:06:02.570
Zeljko Ivezic: they could be one dimension of like those toy in, they could be 1,000 dimensional doesn't matter. You multiply the 2 probability distributions.

347
02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:10.690
Zeljko Ivezic: You will normalize them to one. Then you integrate over all the

348
02:06:11.620 --> 02:06:21.730
Zeljko Ivezic: and then we get the stereotypical distribution published it. We get paper out of it. You get Nobel Prize, or you can use it as prior for the next measurement.

349
02:06:21.730 --> 02:06:33.320
Zeljko Ivezic: And then you do either another measurement or at the same time, you can do completely different measurements, like in cosmology. People who look at supernovae. They get one of stereo

350
02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:46.200
Zeljko Ivezic: for distribution. There's some other people who take the licensing of galaxies. They get other control, and they just multiply them. It's plan one or the other. And then what? Banana? Stop the plan you get at the end something that is your best. It's multiple.

351
02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:50.250
Zeljko Ivezic: so that

352
02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:53.490
Zeljko Ivezic: so as simple as that.

353
02:06:54.530 --> 02:06:56.910
Zeljko Ivezic: Now, what do we do about priors?

354
02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:04.590
Zeljko Ivezic: So price can be in the format, or

355
02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:14.770
Zeljko Ivezic: you've formed? It is when you have some private measurements, and you just say that's distribution, and you

356
02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:17.370
Zeljko Ivezic: sometimes you don't know anything.

357
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:21.650
Zeljko Ivezic: and then often you just take

358
02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:27.380
Zeljko Ivezic: like Prior does not necessarily mean that it's uninformative.

359
02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:32.280
Zeljko Ivezic: You have to be very careful about. The

360
02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:37.060
Zeljko Ivezic: one case is, I think.

361
02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:48.820
Zeljko Ivezic: this one was primary of the If I have the same probability of the it's getting hurt. That's fair kilometer anywhere. So all directions are

362
02:07:48.830 --> 02:08:00.680
Zeljko Ivezic: equally probable. If I express the probability, they are attitude. then it's not uniform anymore. because the spacing of

363
02:08:00.860 --> 02:08:02.810
Zeljko Ivezic: is is

364
02:08:02.910 --> 02:08:09.780
Zeljko Ivezic: less closely on them, and they all collapsed at the at the ports because of spherical coordinate system.

365
02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:25.590
Zeljko Ivezic: So if I tell you it's everywhere on earth when you translate now this into probability, that latitude, it's not flat. It's not horizontal line at you know. So that's one thing that we have to think about when we have these effects of kernel or the linear spaces.

366
02:08:26.510 --> 02:08:30.430
Zeljko Ivezic: In general. The 2 most important examples are

367
02:08:30.730 --> 02:08:34.870
Zeljko Ivezic: when you have to set location and scale virus

368
02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:39.160
Zeljko Ivezic: like New and Sigma for that. That's the simplest.

369
02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:44.610
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you sometimes we know that it has to be positive.

370
02:08:44.980 --> 02:08:49.890
Zeljko Ivezic: so you say it has to go from 0. I can go to infinity

371
02:08:50.070 --> 02:09:05.290
Zeljko Ivezic: sometimes. It doesn't have to go into anything. Let's say, I measured voltage in this wall, as we said, I know it can be 1 million bucks. I don't know whether it's 210 to 2231, 18, somewhere there, but it's not 1 million.

372
02:09:05.530 --> 02:09:08.720
Zeljko Ivezic: And so basically you can put your allowed range

373
02:09:09.070 --> 02:09:15.100
Zeljko Ivezic: between some minimum value and maximum value, and you have flat prior, and that's

374
02:09:16.110 --> 02:09:21.950
Zeljko Ivezic: quite often happens for the translation of the variance. So now you can move it, translate.

375
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:24.140
Zeljko Ivezic: And so in this case you put.

376
02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:26.160
Zeljko Ivezic: leave me a flat punch.

377
02:09:26.580 --> 02:09:28.580
Zeljko Ivezic: Now, when you have scale.

378
02:09:29.090 --> 02:09:32.640
Zeljko Ivezic: like many.

379
02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:34.950
Zeljko Ivezic: you can show

380
02:09:35.190 --> 02:09:38.820
Zeljko Ivezic: using different principles. One of them is

381
02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:46.590
Zeljko Ivezic: to get there in the moment. You can show that for those ones. You have such a product in log space.

382
02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:59.610
Zeljko Ivezic: which means that it's one over kilometer, a 1 million space. So that's the rule of time. If you have no other information. and you want to place an informative prior

383
02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:05.200
Zeljko Ivezic: on your scale

384
02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:23.310
Zeljko Ivezic: for location that takes some cloud distribution. We then allowed range. Sometimes it's easy. For example, if you're rolling down, you simply say probability of each side of 6 of sites is one over 6. That's trivial

385
02:10:23.310 --> 02:10:36.560
Zeljko Ivezic: in complicated problems with complicated distribution. Sometimes you can write entropy. There is concept called entropy for probability distribution, which is directly related to entropy in thermodynamical context.

386
02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:44.730
Zeljko Ivezic: and there you can write that expression, and you can maximize the meaning. You minimize the information content.

387
02:10:44.970 --> 02:10:53.550
Zeljko Ivezic: And there are many papers, interesting papers written about it, especially with a physicist, and it was in thermodynamics. But of course we cannot go it.

388
02:10:54.660 --> 02:11:05.620
Zeljko Ivezic: so we'll now go and look at few more numerical examples. So going back to our bus. So we just learned that for

389
02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:09.770
Zeljko Ivezic: scale parameter we can use.

390
02:11:11.100 --> 02:11:15.140
Zeljko Ivezic: Let's distribution of log space, which is one over the

391
02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:22.870
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now we will modify our likelihood my multiplying against with the driver.

392
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:25.660
and it it's just

393
02:11:25.770 --> 02:11:27.520
Zeljko Ivezic: fewer coincidence

394
02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:31.690
Zeljko Ivezic: that in this example the 2 are the same so long get confused.

395
02:11:31.980 --> 02:11:35.500
Zeljko Ivezic: The the came up.

396
02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:39.740
Zeljko Ivezic: It's one over the

397
02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:46.700
Zeljko Ivezic: because, we said, we know that cannot be smaller than T.

398
02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:48.090
Zeljko Ivezic: How is

399
02:11:48.210 --> 02:11:57.710
Zeljko Ivezic: time between 2 arrival of the bus, and it' be very some time in between, so team must be less than power. But that has to be greater. The team.

400
02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:01.930
Zeljko Ivezic: That's why we have.

401
02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:07.480
Zeljko Ivezic: as in town, and in that range we take uniforms

402
02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:09.980
the uniform likely for

403
02:12:10.410 --> 02:12:29.200
Zeljko Ivezic: T as a function of now, because it has to integrate to one. And the way this is found out, then one over 2 is the amplitude. That's how likely it would be t one over the the price of

404
02:12:29.210 --> 02:12:33.030
Zeljko Ivezic: Then we take one over 5. So it's same function. But

405
02:12:33.090 --> 02:12:42.330
Zeljko Ivezic: we are planning to the same function from 2 totally different directions. And so now that i'm not in like 101 of it how I get one of it out of the.

406
02:12:42.630 --> 02:12:46.910
Zeljko Ivezic: And now, actually, I get results for the

407
02:12:47.190 --> 02:12:51.200
Zeljko Ivezic: probability, distribution, and and for the maximum of that

408
02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:55.480
Zeljko Ivezic: for a Median, but simply

409
02:12:56.390 --> 02:13:02.240
Zeljko Ivezic: integrating that function. And I get my results that I intuitively expect

410
02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:11.110
Zeljko Ivezic: that the best estimate of how is 2 times, c. Not one times.

411
02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:17.560
Zeljko Ivezic: And now that I have this distribution, I can now calculate any one time.

412
02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:28.170
Zeljko Ivezic: So now you can say you have to your friend. unsuspecting friend at the bus station, and be waiting for us for 10 min.

413
02:13:28.650 --> 02:13:30.720
Now you can start getting.

414
02:13:30.900 --> 02:13:33.870
Zeljko Ivezic: How long will it take for that bus to run.

415
02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:44.260
Zeljko Ivezic: and I can do exactly the same calculation. It's because you know the whole distribution, and in particular, if you want to be 95% confident.

416
02:13:44.420 --> 02:13:47.810
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you want to lose only one back in 20,

417
02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:55.430
Zeljko Ivezic: then you can easily show by integrating that function that if you waited for 2 min for your bus.

418
02:13:56.180 --> 02:13:58.780
Zeljko Ivezic: Then you know that your bus

419
02:13:59.220 --> 02:14:04.500
Zeljko Ivezic: comes every 1.0 3 5, c. And less than 4.

420
02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:16.420
Zeljko Ivezic: There was one professor of faster physics in pristine. who was going for a few years around the country during the silly talk where

421
02:14:16.450 --> 02:14:31.400
Zeljko Ivezic: he used just before him. And then at that time Berlin more came down. So he was saying, well given that it took so long for barely involved to stand up. Then he was predicting other buildings. Very simply. Use this for you.

422
02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:33.110
Zeljko Ivezic: So I could say

423
02:14:34.020 --> 02:14:36.940
Zeljko Ivezic: one example in our context.

424
02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:38.110
Zeljko Ivezic: like.

425
02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:42.510
Zeljko Ivezic: How long did we wait for the Government to fix

426
02:14:42.610 --> 02:14:50.660
Zeljko Ivezic: the buildings from the last third place. So far we've been baking for 2 years, but so we can say at 95

427
02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:53.210
Zeljko Ivezic: percent confidence level

428
02:14:53.300 --> 02:14:58.850
Zeljko Ivezic: it will pay between 2.0 6 us for them to fix, and 80.

429
02:15:00.290 --> 02:15:02.480
Zeljko Ivezic: Yes, you are 95% confident

430
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:07.760
Zeljko Ivezic: it is a lot. But don't underestimate the government.

431
02:15:10.070 --> 02:15:17.820
Zeljko Ivezic: So let's stop for a moment. There is one more topic for today, so let me just stop here for a moment and see if there are now questions.

432
02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:20.370
Zeljko Ivezic: notification, etc.

433
02:15:40.090 --> 02:15:47.300
Zeljko Ivezic: So I just remembered that Laura told me when I left office. Don't forget to repeat the questions.

434
02:15:47.610 --> 02:15:50.580
Zeljko Ivezic: So the question for those on zoom are.

435
02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:59.150
Zeljko Ivezic: is, what is the concept of entropy in in in in this context of Bayesian statistics.

436
02:15:59.410 --> 02:16:02.890
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is not, strictly speaking.

437
02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:05.910
Zeljko Ivezic: connected only to

438
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:11.580
Zeljko Ivezic: in general. You can define for every probability distribution.

439
02:16:11.740 --> 02:16:14.110
Zeljko Ivezic: What is it? Information content?

440
02:16:15.310 --> 02:16:22.780
Zeljko Ivezic: And so that then depends on its shape. It depends on how wide it is. If you just look at Gaussian.

441
02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:30.340
Zeljko Ivezic: Then the narrow, the narrow where the Gaussian is, the more information is contained in that distribution.

442
02:16:30.980 --> 02:16:38.629
Zeljko Ivezic: If you have very wide Gaussian and I ask you. Where are you on the taxes? Because many

443
02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:45.389
Zeljko Ivezic: values are are allowed. There is not much information content, contest

444
02:16:45.459 --> 02:16:46.340
Zeljko Ivezic: on

445
02:16:46.420 --> 02:16:56.379
Zeljko Ivezic: 1010 it now, if I make a very narrow Gaussian. Then, essentially, i'm certain that that value is here. I know a lot. This is huge

446
02:16:56.780 --> 02:17:06.900
Zeljko Ivezic: information content. So for Gaussian it goes. Basically it's one over Sigma that the information is proportional to one over Sigma or entropy.

447
02:17:07.660 --> 02:17:15.240
Zeljko Ivezic: which increases as information goes down. So entropy in thermodynamics spontaneously increases.

448
02:17:15.690 --> 02:17:27.350
Zeljko Ivezic: So Basically, there. Then you can say that entropy for Gaussian distribution increases with Sigma. The why there is Gaussian, the more entropy, the less information content it has

449
02:17:27.639 --> 02:17:31.040
Zeljko Ivezic: Now. when you imagine

450
02:17:31.809 --> 02:17:40.760
Zeljko Ivezic: in some space it's almost identical derivation to what you do in thermodynamics when you take thermodynamics for the first time.

451
02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:53.870
Zeljko Ivezic: But in in the context of probability. It's similar to innovation. But we don't talk about thermodynamics. It's actually generally true for the distributions, you know, in space. Then you imagine that that space can be separated.

452
02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:58.340
Zeljko Ivezic: Small control volumes, small parcels of face space.

453
02:17:58.420 --> 02:18:03.680
Zeljko Ivezic: And then you ask, how many ways can I populate these

454
02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:05.160
Zeljko Ivezic: unit volumes

455
02:18:05.170 --> 02:18:11.040
Zeljko Ivezic: with a particle 0 one how many of them can have particle? And then you write very complicated

456
02:18:11.070 --> 02:18:12.360
Zeljko Ivezic: expression.

457
02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:19.370
Zeljko Ivezic: combinatorial expression, and then you connect it with your probability distribution, and you get something roughly like

458
02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:35.639
Zeljko Ivezic: Ln of. If your distribution is P. Of x, then your entropy is proportional to a Ln. Of P. Of X. And that's the same formula that then leads you to second law of thermodynamics. And in this context you basically menu

459
02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:41.440
Zeljko Ivezic: specified probability distribution. Then you can choose parameters to maximize them

460
02:18:41.450 --> 02:18:46.190
Zeljko Ivezic: Entropy, meaning to minimize the information that you put in this.

461
02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:55.500
Zeljko Ivezic: And again, the few pages Let's describe it very nicely in that book by I can bring it next time if

462
02:18:55.719 --> 02:18:58.190
Zeljko Ivezic: if people want to create it in more detail.

463
02:18:58.610 --> 02:19:03.000
Zeljko Ivezic: But in our context, since we are limited on time, we didn't.

464
02:19:03.650 --> 02:19:17.219
Zeljko Ivezic: You're right. You just stated. That's another way of choosing priors for the rest of the lectures. It's sufficient to know that for location prior to just state uniform distribution for scale parameters to just take one over to.

465
02:19:18.530 --> 02:19:25.840
Zeljko Ivezic: But in complicated cases maximum entropy will allow you to get minimal information in your

466
02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:27.809
Zeljko Ivezic: for your product

467
02:19:28.830 --> 02:19:40.000
Zeljko Ivezic: like one example from Cbi is, he starts with the simplest possible example of rolling dice. And what do you do? Well, if you don't know

468
02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:48.420
Zeljko Ivezic: anything about the dice. If you think it's fair, then obviously you put 1 6 for probability for each side.

469
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:51.630
Zeljko Ivezic: But then he has interesting example, where he says.

470
02:19:51.780 --> 02:19:55.440
Zeljko Ivezic: imagine now that it's not a fair dice.

471
02:19:55.660 --> 02:20:02.490
Zeljko Ivezic: And the only thing I know about that guys is that on average gives you the score of 2,

472
02:20:03.070 --> 02:20:13.630
Zeljko Ivezic: which is less than what real and so given that constraint, what should I use for Prior for each of these 6 size?

473
02:20:13.890 --> 02:20:18.520
Zeljko Ivezic: And then you you write down your expectation value. and then you

474
02:20:18.780 --> 02:20:32.260
Zeljko Ivezic: have this constraint. It's all not like like the Lagrange multiplier, and then you multiply entropy and you get probabilities for inside. But it's it's beyond the scope of our it's a. It's a powerful principle.

475
02:20:35.130 --> 02:20:47.030
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay. And now let's talk about the last main component. or by a again approach to data analysis. one that is important because it allows you to

476
02:20:47.170 --> 02:20:56.070
Zeljko Ivezic: make complex models of how your measurements are generated. And yet you can then, Iran.

477
02:20:56.220 --> 02:21:00.770
Zeljko Ivezic: the posterior distributions for some parameters of interest.

478
02:21:00.780 --> 02:21:03.000
Zeljko Ivezic: This is only one out of many.

479
02:21:04.590 --> 02:21:05.940
Zeljko Ivezic: So

480
02:21:06.030 --> 02:21:09.380
Zeljko Ivezic: we will go back to that example of

481
02:21:09.650 --> 02:21:11.620
Zeljko Ivezic: 2 dimensional Gaussian.

482
02:21:13.140 --> 02:21:15.390
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay, my in the wrong place.

483
02:21:18.980 --> 02:21:28.760
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay, this is just okay. This is introduction. So we'll end up with the same Forum way. So we are basically doing, looking at the same line like this we did last time.

484
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:38.230
Zeljko Ivezic: but now we are multiplying by some constant, because we are assuming flat private, and that there is some range allowed for you.

485
02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:47.790
Zeljko Ivezic: And so between those 2 values which can be much wider than our posterior galaxy. So basically, it's irrelevant. But formally

486
02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:54.040
Zeljko Ivezic: we are multiplying by some constant, and we end up with the same results for the posterior

487
02:21:54.610 --> 02:21:55.550
Zeljko Ivezic: for me.

488
02:21:56.020 --> 02:22:05.200
Zeljko Ivezic: That's Monday. Now, if you want to go to to the we basically again follow the same approach. We start with likelihood

489
02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:12.220
Zeljko Ivezic: now it could smell in, and we are assuming that measurements in certain so small.

490
02:22:12.660 --> 02:22:21.440
Zeljko Ivezic: equal, and negligible compared to Sigma. So what our measure is it's on.

491
02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:27.040
Zeljko Ivezic: and we'll assume that new is some interesting physical quantity

492
02:22:28.060 --> 02:22:30.520
Zeljko Ivezic: that's really here. This Nobel prize.

493
02:22:30.690 --> 02:22:35.340
Zeljko Ivezic: But Sigma is some result of our measurement process

494
02:22:35.370 --> 02:22:37.370
Zeljko Ivezic: that people who care less about.

495
02:22:38.570 --> 02:22:50.750
Zeljko Ivezic: But that Sigma has an impact on what we measure for me. We have to treat both. We have to write this likelihood as a function of the environment.

496
02:22:50.780 --> 02:22:58.310
Zeljko Ivezic: They have impact on our measurement, but we don't know what that is. So it is not one dimensional problem. It is still dimensional.

497
02:22:59.700 --> 02:23:03.070
Zeljko Ivezic: but ultimately I only care about mute. Take care of it.

498
02:23:03.210 --> 02:23:08.740
Zeljko Ivezic: I want to show one dimension of a stereo.

499
02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:18.530
Zeljko Ivezic: So what do I do? So again? First step I choose my private. and, as we said, for location will take uniform Prior.

500
02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:30.690
Zeljko Ivezic: It's some range for scale. Sigma, we'll take one of the Sigma again in summary, Sigma in Sigma, Max. It can be 0 if you have more information through something that.

501
02:23:31.850 --> 02:23:38.210
Zeljko Ivezic: And so, then, that just becomes a boring, constant normalization

502
02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:39.290
Zeljko Ivezic: expression.

503
02:23:39.690 --> 02:23:44.360
Zeljko Ivezic: And I don't even have to evaluate it explicitly, because numerically

504
02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:45.900
Zeljko Ivezic: in practice.

505
02:23:50.220 --> 02:23:51.610
Zeljko Ivezic: And so.

506
02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:58.840
Zeljko Ivezic: then, when I take law of that probability I get my expression

507
02:23:59.070 --> 02:24:08.060
Zeljko Ivezic: for posterior, and as we discussed with last time, you can rearrange out to bright like this equation to end up with the last one

508
02:24:08.700 --> 02:24:21.960
Zeljko Ivezic: in the last client we don't have x on, and some of that what we have are only 2 numbers that are based on data mean value. X, bar and variance

509
02:24:22.050 --> 02:24:25.750
Zeljko Ivezic: B, which is Sigma squared. So I summarize

510
02:24:26.270 --> 02:24:30.380
Zeljko Ivezic: my data set. It's only 2 numbers or 3, if you count, and

511
02:24:31.170 --> 02:24:35.870
Zeljko Ivezic: and so that is now some function

512
02:24:36.050 --> 02:24:47.510
Zeljko Ivezic: and given from data X, bar, and V, and then I can now look at it. Distribution, function, and I can find, for example, it's maximum value Mu and Sigma.

513
02:24:47.530 --> 02:24:50.820
Zeljko Ivezic: But what I again really want to know is

514
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:57.620
Zeljko Ivezic: what is the marginal distribution of you. So if you pay the last.

515
02:24:57.820 --> 02:25:03.920
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now this is small, let me make it bigger. It says in the top

516
02:25:09.450 --> 02:25:11.250
Zeljko Ivezic: at the top. It says

517
02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:14.590
Zeljko Ivezic: X bar is one

518
02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:19.010
Zeljko Ivezic: B is 4, and an extent. Is it? Just on 3?

519
02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:20.960
Zeljko Ivezic: It's a small.

520
02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:26.490
Zeljko Ivezic: remember. Last time we were.

521
02:25:26.780 --> 02:25:33.440
Zeljko Ivezic: and then it was collapsing more here is large because, and it.

522
02:25:33.810 --> 02:25:42.120
Zeljko Ivezic: and because mean value, is one. It's roughly centered of me with one, because we know that me is good.

523
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:51.990
Zeljko Ivezic: So it is roughly centered on one. But now it has this wide base, because I don't know about the Sigma. So what you want to do in practice is integrate

524
02:25:52.390 --> 02:26:05.040
Zeljko Ivezic: in the Sigma direction for each value of you, Benji, there is a narrow bar now vertical part. I go through this bar, and I just add on all the pixels in that bar. Basically, I'm Americanly integrate

525
02:26:05.810 --> 02:26:07.480
Zeljko Ivezic: all sigma values.

526
02:26:07.850 --> 02:26:16.620
Zeljko Ivezic: and I get probability for new at that position. Then I go here. I integrate, add up everything at the end. I can again renormalize.

527
02:26:16.980 --> 02:26:20.850
Zeljko Ivezic: and I will get beautiful probability distribution from you

528
02:26:20.890 --> 02:26:27.460
Zeljko Ivezic: that doesn't care about Sigma that is called marginalization. In

529
02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:30.990
Zeljko Ivezic: so often, when we have complicated

530
02:26:31.010 --> 02:26:39.390
Zeljko Ivezic: set ups, sometimes people may models that include hundreds of sometimes even thousands of free parameters.

531
02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:43.200
Zeljko Ivezic: just to be able to model the behavior of the

532
02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:47.660
Zeljko Ivezic: But not all of those parameters are basically

533
02:26:47.860 --> 02:26:57.220
Zeljko Ivezic: maybe one or handful of them. And in this case, then they integrate over unknown parameters in order to get posterior distribution.

534
02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:05.580
Zeljko Ivezic: and in this particular example and that will go back now to question about.

535
02:27:06.310 --> 02:27:17.530
Zeljko Ivezic: So in this example we that for me. But I just show you before the plot. You can actually do this marginalization with integration. Analytically.

536
02:27:18.090 --> 02:27:25.420
Zeljko Ivezic: I can take that formula up there in top. That formula is function, Sigma, and its function of mute.

537
02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:32.240
Zeljko Ivezic: I can analytically integrate it over a new. I can analytically integrate our signal.

538
02:27:32.450 --> 02:27:34.700
Zeljko Ivezic: and in particular, the result

539
02:27:35.140 --> 02:27:43.530
Zeljko Ivezic: for marginalized distribution of you and integrate over Sigma is very illuminate. That's the last line.

540
02:27:43.850 --> 02:27:50.130
Zeljko Ivezic: It says probability of you is equal to he's ugly thinking.

541
02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:57.790
Zeljko Ivezic: but to be remembered for central limit to yourm. You remember from kindergarten that if you had any measured

542
02:27:58.210 --> 02:28:01.440
Zeljko Ivezic: your best estimator of the underlying patient.

543
02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:14.770
Zeljko Ivezic: and what we get there is not to do that. So what time?

544
02:28:16.250 --> 02:28:21.260
Zeljko Ivezic: What happened is that this is general result.

545
02:28:25.050 --> 02:28:28.580
Zeljko Ivezic: and it's valid for any and even a small man

546
02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:36.160
Zeljko Ivezic: central limit, or if you read carefully the first set, you have very large number of measurements, and, as

547
02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:50.290
Zeljko Ivezic: will be very large in practice, it's only about 10. That's why we make students to television. And this now, the paper will explain you why we made students to 10 measurements. It's not because we have 10 fingers.

548
02:28:50.930 --> 02:28:55.470
Zeljko Ivezic: So this plot now shows this marginal.

549
02:28:56.710 --> 02:28:57.740
Zeljko Ivezic: and it is

550
02:28:58.580 --> 02:29:14.150
Zeljko Ivezic: the the desk Ones is what sense? Probably it's theorem tell you the results. Those are Gaussians settled on true value, and their bit is given by the 3 Sigma those

551
02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:18.220
Zeljko Ivezic: but the true result in a solid month.

552
02:29:18.430 --> 02:29:22.180
Zeljko Ivezic: And now, if you look at

553
02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:25.800
Zeljko Ivezic: the 2 lines. 2:

554
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:34.290
Zeljko Ivezic: the true answer. It's solid line. It was very similar to des plans, so we can the 2 lines most.

555
02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:38.250
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's, of course, well known results the

556
02:29:38.310 --> 02:29:48.330
Zeljko Ivezic: it's expression for the so called students t Distribution. It's one another one of those.

557
02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:51.570
Zeljko Ivezic: but in this case.

558
02:29:51.620 --> 02:29:59.760
Zeljko Ivezic: and it is well known that as you go to large and the students see distribution more.

559
02:30:00.700 --> 02:30:02.730
Zeljko Ivezic: and that happens around end of 10,

560
02:30:02.910 --> 02:30:12.360
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you can take your Gaussian results from the central, and then you can teach your undergrads. Yeah, just take the mean value and calculate variance, and you're done.

561
02:30:12.590 --> 02:30:14.250
Zeljko Ivezic: But in the

562
02:30:14.540 --> 02:30:20.510
Zeljko Ivezic: if n is less than 10. You don't get that in particular. Look at this full line.

563
02:30:21.130 --> 02:30:25.550
Zeljko Ivezic: The solid blue line is what you would get if you ninety-eightly.

564
02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:37.340
Zeljko Ivezic: and if you apply it to your but at the actual result is solid one. Sorry the dash line in guys.

565
02:30:37.700 --> 02:30:40.050
Zeljko Ivezic: so the solid blue one

566
02:30:40.100 --> 02:30:44.780
Zeljko Ivezic: as sales that it spent much further out

567
02:30:45.030 --> 02:30:51.250
Zeljko Ivezic: then would like to. So now I assume you have this 3 measurements.

568
02:30:51.710 --> 02:30:55.370
Zeljko Ivezic: and I asked you given this 3 measurements.

569
02:30:55.580 --> 02:30:58.170
Zeljko Ivezic: Is it possible that the

570
02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:00.400
Zeljko Ivezic: I from you

571
02:31:00.450 --> 02:31:01.420
would be fine.

572
02:31:01.580 --> 02:31:07.510
Zeljko Ivezic: and i'm serious about it, because it's something that will make me die or lose 1 million dollars

573
02:31:10.270 --> 02:31:11.890
Zeljko Ivezic: where the new is

574
02:31:12.740 --> 02:31:28.040
Zeljko Ivezic: 5 a month, because if it's 3 or 200, but it's meal is large, as one is fine, i'll get in so. And now you go to calculation, and you don't know statistics. You take your under good lab. It's all it's.

575
02:31:28.120 --> 02:31:31.100
Zeljko Ivezic: Probability drops to 0 if you're good.

576
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:36.270
Zeljko Ivezic: But in reality it. Those 3 measurements

577
02:31:36.430 --> 02:31:41.180
Zeljko Ivezic: will not allow you to rule out.

578
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:44.100
Zeljko Ivezic: Because

579
02:31:45.370 --> 02:31:49.820
Zeljko Ivezic: and interestingly. that's exactly what happened in practice

580
02:31:50.250 --> 02:31:53.240
Zeljko Ivezic: during the economic crisis.

581
02:31:54.330 --> 02:31:57.380
Zeljko Ivezic: One of the main

582
02:31:57.790 --> 02:32:03.150
Zeljko Ivezic: right it's; for when the

583
02:32:03.700 --> 02:32:14.380
Zeljko Ivezic: and the way they need to predict it was to their models.

584
02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:19.600
Zeljko Ivezic: what is the probability of before? And the whole model was much more complicated.

585
02:32:20.650 --> 02:32:24.570
Zeljko Ivezic: but

586
02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:36.000
Zeljko Ivezic: that they but they had a small number of measurements effectively.

587
02:32:37.530 --> 02:32:43.370
Zeljko Ivezic: So it wasn't any.

588
02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:46.600
Zeljko Ivezic: because someone

589
02:32:55.700 --> 02:33:01.020
Zeljko Ivezic: it's cool that we funny, and that we find it's like 4 4 4,

590
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:04.370
Zeljko Ivezic: I would be

591
02:33:04.730 --> 02:33:10.750
Zeljko Ivezic: but actually what these guys did in the original X one was not highly unusual.

592
02:33:11.130 --> 02:33:23.310
Zeljko Ivezic: Well, it's a it's a totally fine. It's just they use the wrong expression. They said it could not happen. It did happen that people started reporting, because essentially we have the

593
02:33:23.780 --> 02:33:31.820
Zeljko Ivezic: so that goes back someone calling in the backpack in the first lecture about 10.

594
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:37.600
Zeljko Ivezic: So it is not Gaussian until you hit 10 or so. Then it becomes Gaussian.

595
02:33:38.430 --> 02:33:43.340
Zeljko Ivezic: and this in this context of Gaussian marginalization.

596
02:33:43.390 --> 02:33:44.880
Zeljko Ivezic: this comes next.

597
02:33:45.030 --> 02:33:48.480
Zeljko Ivezic: You don't have to do anything.

598
02:33:50.810 --> 02:33:59.260
Zeljko Ivezic: You have 2 dimensional function you integrated over Sigma, and you get a stereo for meal, which is actually students.

599
02:33:59.950 --> 02:34:11.500
Zeljko Ivezic: And this is another summary of of this conclusion, that if you have small number of measurements. You have to be very careful about the taste of the distributions

600
02:34:11.620 --> 02:34:13.890
Zeljko Ivezic: I here. It's comparison off

601
02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:21.230
Zeljko Ivezic: Gaussian distribution, and the 2 students, the distribution and the businesses can be remarkable.

602
02:34:22.580 --> 02:34:29.510
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's the the last topic for today. Next time it will go slightly.

603
02:34:30.980 --> 02:34:42.110
Zeljko Ivezic: with slightly more examples of the same concept that we did today when it settles down a little bit. So for the next time please try to go again through this lecture today.

604
02:34:42.310 --> 02:34:44.400
Zeljko Ivezic: trying to look at least at

605
02:34:44.510 --> 02:34:48.020
Zeljko Ivezic: first half of the

606
02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:51.550
Zeljko Ivezic: which is the same topics. and then.

607
02:34:52.280 --> 02:35:00.830
Zeljko Ivezic: if you have time, look at those you can especially you can talk about until aspects and simulation. Look at those J funded classes

608
02:35:01.090 --> 02:35:07.120
Zeljko Ivezic: links that I put at the beginning of this lecture. So next time we'll we'll finish some more

609
02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:21.000
Zeljko Ivezic: examples with different likelihoods and different approaches to these updates of measurements. And then we'll talk about new concepts called model probabilities.

610
02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:25.530
Zeljko Ivezic: So we still have 2 min for questions. We have questions.

611
02:35:25.890 --> 02:35:28.220
Zeljko Ivezic: If not, I think we are that one today.

612
02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:31.300
Zeljko Ivezic: Questions.

613
02:35:33.250 --> 02:35:35.940
Zeljko Ivezic: Don't feel bad if this all sounds.

614
02:35:37.610 --> 02:35:39.750
Zeljko Ivezic: And what is he talking

615
02:35:40.270 --> 02:35:46.080
Zeljko Ivezic: First time you you hear this it's confusing. Took me many readings in the beginning

616
02:35:46.080 --> 02:36:07.290
Zeljko Ivezic: to actually realize how, when you technically operate that book by Syria gets you very excited, it's your topical approach and simple examples. But to go to more complicated examples, take some practice. Take some thinking. What is Prior? Why, prior, what is like you, etc. So it is okay to feel like I have no idea what's going on.

617
02:36:07.290 --> 02:36:19.420
Zeljko Ivezic: but it will be better again if you go again. It's your own base for the awards, and then look at the beginning of the next lecture. And if you have time to look at what jay growth, because Jake is very talented for explaining.

618
02:36:21.470 --> 02:36:24.970
Zeljko Ivezic: I thought I saw one hand now. There was it off, Alex.

619
02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:28.580
So we'll be most of the talk with.

620
02:36:42.510 --> 02:36:48.450
Zeljko Ivezic: so i'm not

621
02:37:06.940 --> 02:37:09.540
Zeljko Ivezic: they.

622
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:16.660
Zeljko Ivezic: You 1 s.

623
02:37:27.290 --> 02:37:32.690
Zeljko Ivezic: Yeah. So it's not really let's start with classical statistics. Predicts wrong. Answer.

624
02:37:33.060 --> 02:37:35.440
Zeljko Ivezic: It is answering different questions.

625
02:37:36.010 --> 02:37:38.120
Zeljko Ivezic: So I, when I ask

626
02:37:38.380 --> 02:37:46.940
Zeljko Ivezic: given the youbage for so long. What is the best I can tell you about it? That is a different question.

627
02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:53.420
Zeljko Ivezic: Then what classical statistic is answering. So, in a sense I kind of cheated you. I

628
02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:59.710
Zeljko Ivezic: through it without emphasizing that what started what Maxine would give you?

629
02:37:59.790 --> 02:38:07.940
Zeljko Ivezic: It's not the answer to this. So it's not that maximum likelihood method is wrong. It is that it is answering different

630
02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:14.900
Zeljko Ivezic: question. It's answering the question. If I repeated this experiment

631
02:38:15.050 --> 02:38:16.870
Zeljko Ivezic: many many times.

632
02:38:18.050 --> 02:38:21.340
Zeljko Ivezic: what would be the most frequent?

633
02:38:22.250 --> 02:38:23.290
Zeljko Ivezic: Where are you?

634
02:38:25.620 --> 02:38:34.710
Zeljko Ivezic: What would be the confidence limit for the truth if I took that maximum solution? Something like that?

635
02:38:34.980 --> 02:38:38.470
Zeljko Ivezic: It's different question. The question we want to know is.

636
02:38:38.500 --> 02:38:43.740
Zeljko Ivezic: if I wait for for 10 min. what is my knowledge of power?

637
02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:48.690
Zeljko Ivezic: And that's what.

638
02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:56.850
Zeljko Ivezic: But you see an approach it is, it was logically pleasing, because it answers questions that we're asking and sign in.

639
02:38:58.590 --> 02:39:00.170
and the other approach.

640
02:39:00.880 --> 02:39:10.250
Zeljko Ivezic: It's a different question that answer them correctly. But these are through the questions that are based on repetition of many experiments, and then looking at the

641
02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:16.260
Zeljko Ivezic: But there is no right and wrong. There is relevant question, and

642
02:39:23.310 --> 02:39:29.260
Zeljko Ivezic: well, I

643
02:39:29.410 --> 02:39:31.050
Zeljko Ivezic: not getting for it.

644
02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:32.810
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay.

645
02:39:40.460 --> 02:39:50.070
Zeljko Ivezic: absolutely. Yeah. There, there is a great book. Maybe I could link for it to, or maybe I removed it because Link was broken. There is Guy called James at James.

646
02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:53.800
He was professor of statistics in St. Louis University.

647
02:39:54.110 --> 02:40:12.820
Zeljko Ivezic: He was the main proponent of the Asian approach, and starting in sixties until about nineties. He was one of handful of people who really changed the way people think about things. So he has this great book, which is 500 pages of something.

648
02:40:12.820 --> 02:40:24.200
Zeljko Ivezic: It's some scary to have a 500 page. It's a but it's a classical. The link that I had was broken. So I didn't have time to look for it. But it's at James.

649
02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:25.630
Zeljko Ivezic: Yeah.

650
02:40:26.770 --> 02:40:33.500
Zeljko Ivezic: Probability of reasoning, I think, is the title. If you're interested in this topic, it's an excellent book to read.

651
02:40:33.510 --> 02:40:36.130
Zeljko Ivezic: Basically it goes very slowly.

652
02:40:36.170 --> 02:40:41.470
Zeljko Ivezic: So all these problems

653
02:40:42.450 --> 02:40:55.030
Zeljko Ivezic: which you cannot find, I think it's call probability of reasoning that I can find this. It used to be on a free website that his student this did for him after he passed away, so I don't know anything.

654
02:40:55.670 --> 02:40:58.140
Zeljko Ivezic: And then, of course, this little book, by Cvi.

655
02:40:58.430 --> 02:41:08.930
Zeljko Ivezic: I would highly recommend to start with that, because it really takes you gently, and it takes you to always stop process without intimidating you with any super complicated

656
02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:10.400
Zeljko Ivezic: Ultimately, automatically.

657
02:41:10.930 --> 02:41:11.640
That's

658
02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:16.890
Zeljko Ivezic: I don't see any other pants

659
02:41:17.970 --> 02:41:20.100
Zeljko Ivezic: first time. Second time.

660
02:41:20.130 --> 02:41:21.530
Zeljko Ivezic: Thank you for coming.
