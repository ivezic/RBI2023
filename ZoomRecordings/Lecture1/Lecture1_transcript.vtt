1
00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.480
Damjan: Yeah.

2
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.570
Cool.

3
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.410
Zeljko Ivezic: Oh, it's muted.

4
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.840
Zeljko Ivezic: Sorry. Zoom attendees. We just 3 of highest levels on mute.

5
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.610
Zeljko Ivezic: I don't know. How did you hear anything? Did they hear anything?

6
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.180
Zeljko Ivezic: Yeah. Yeah, okay.

7
00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.540
Zeljko Ivezic: let me just quickly check. Who do we have?

8
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.340
Zeljko Ivezic: Look up here, Atlanta. Okay.

9
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:15.030
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay. So for those on zoom what I said in summary, is that the only way to benefit from this class is

10
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.300
Zeljko Ivezic: is to

11
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:24.450
Zeljko Ivezic: do work at home. So, after like each lecture, you should go again through it and identify.

12
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.890
Zeljko Ivezic: identify what you didn't understand, so you can ask questions next time.

13
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:38.680
Zeljko Ivezic: and the other thing to do is to prepare yourself for the next lecture by downloading it

14
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:43.960
Zeljko Ivezic: from the github and then trying to run the forward in these lectures, how do I get a single

15
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.200
Zeljko Ivezic: Yeah, yeah.

16
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.770
Zeljko Ivezic: is it? It's not.

17
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.280
Zeljko Ivezic: Oh, thank you.

18
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:15.180
Zeljko Ivezic: Usually you can drag it every I don't know why it's not morning.

19
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.720
Zeljko Ivezic: Maybe because my screen is coming.

20
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.160
Zeljko Ivezic: What is going on. It is

21
00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:00.010
Zeljko Ivezic: I don't know how to get rid of this black screen. Maybe it will go away by itself.

22
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.920
Zeljko Ivezic: So the idea of the class is that we have these, like I for numbers.

23
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:11.510
Zeljko Ivezic: You download it prior to this class. But you don't need Internet and this class, because it's not

24
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:17.530
Zeljko Ivezic: very good. And then, as we go through the pieces of the

25
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:38.550
Zeljko Ivezic: you can execute them on your computer and see that from your and then you'll be able to sometimes modify the quote, Just change something to see that you can actually do it on your own. And as we go deeper in this class, you will find more and more examples that will be relevant to your own research. Hopefully.

26
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:46.830
Zeljko Ivezic: So today I will start by just providing a brief roadmap for

27
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:52.150
Zeljko Ivezic: the class. I will briefly describe each of these 6 lectures for the first

28
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:56.730
Zeljko Ivezic: part of the course, and then we will go

29
00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:02.760
Zeljko Ivezic: to the rest of the lecture one. Let me see if this works. So this class is basically

30
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:20.580
Zeljko Ivezic: shortened compressed version of this book. I'm not saying you should buy this book. It's expensive. Most of money doesn't go to me, unfortunately. But nevertheless, if you have this book, you will be able to find a longer version of the stuff that i'm going to talk about in these lectures.

31
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.220
Zeljko Ivezic: Oh, I hate Zoom.

32
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.400
Zeljko Ivezic: No, this is safari. It's unrelated to zoom.

33
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.420
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay. except for this one.

34
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:14.320
Zeljko Ivezic: This is better. All right. So just quickly. How many of you managed to reproduce this plot on your own computer?

35
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:30.250
Zeljko Ivezic: Whoa, you? Good! Good, All right. So we'll at some point. We'll talk about this Pl: it's basically visualization of 3 dimensional distribution. You measure 3 quantities for large number of

36
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:40.200
Zeljko Ivezic: samples, and then you try to visualize it, and we'll get back to it later. Excellent! So you can run all of that on your on your computer.

37
00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:50.890
Zeljko Ivezic: So again, the point of the class is to show you some of the main benefits, and how we use them to show our our example. It's like you. Go to

38
00:15:51.090 --> 00:16:01.900
Zeljko Ivezic: it's like you go to a

39
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:08.160
Zeljko Ivezic: bucket of face and brush, and show you all this drug which is used with pay from the wall.

40
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:19.390
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is what it is for that doesn't make you immediately an expert in painting walls. You cannot go on the market and make money by taking People's house takes some practice.

41
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:27.510
Zeljko Ivezic: even though you know how to use the brush. It takes some practice. So the same with this and that's based on the experience from any other

42
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:35.410
Zeljko Ivezic: extra serious like this in summer schools, unless you try it yourself. You will forget in one month which you did in this class.

43
00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:43.680
Zeljko Ivezic: and especially since most of you or all of you are already doing some kind of research. Whenever we talk about

44
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.780
Zeljko Ivezic: some methodology, try to think about.

45
00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.280
Zeljko Ivezic: How does that relate to my research?

46
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:58.430
Zeljko Ivezic: I think it's almost impossible that there will be no part of this class that is not related to your own research, no matter what you do. If you're working with data.

47
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.250
Zeljko Ivezic: so there will be some overlap.

48
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:09.339
Zeljko Ivezic: So let me now quickly go through what will be covered. So today will be the most important lecture of all

49
00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:15.670
Zeljko Ivezic: all other lectures will be more interesting, because today we need to put

50
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:22.150
Zeljko Ivezic: foundations and introduced language that will be using in other ways that just the

51
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:31.100
Zeljko Ivezic: The fundamental part of this first series is to teach you to show you what is biased and statistics about. Why is it important in science

52
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.090
Zeljko Ivezic: and some methods like

53
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:48.750
Zeljko Ivezic: a client to so many complicated problems. But to introduce, to explain what, by using a statistics is about, you need to know what is the likelihood method, what is maximum likelihood approach.

54
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:53.230
Zeljko Ivezic: and that will be part of the second lecture. But to start talking about

55
00:17:53.340 --> 00:18:00.030
Zeljko Ivezic: maximum likelihood and things like, and probabilities and goodness of fit

56
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.270
Zeljko Ivezic: we need to.

57
00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:20.920
Zeljko Ivezic: And so this first lecture today, which will be the most boring one, is about that foundation about the common language about nomenclature that we'll be using throughout the class. So we start the tree we will go through today. We will be powered, then to go to discussion of

58
00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.960
Zeljko Ivezic: maximum likelihood when we meet next week.

59
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:39.320
Zeljko Ivezic: So then, once we are done with maximum likelihood, then we need to produce concept of bias and statistics, which is basically maximum likelihood combined with the concept of prior probabilities.

60
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:50.750
Zeljko Ivezic: And once we introduce this concept. then it will show some applications that will be moderately complicated or simple. There will be some

61
00:18:51.360 --> 00:19:01.730
Zeljko Ivezic: derivations of things, you know, from your introductory laboratory, or like, how do you do weighted some? How do you fit a line to points that have error bars on them.

62
00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:15.060
Zeljko Ivezic: That's usually we take as of like box, and never think out about how we're going to be right. but with by statistics it's trivial to show what is going on. and then, once we go through this basics.

63
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:29.860
Zeljko Ivezic: then we will get to the 2 most important likes in the end one is Markov chain. So this is a method numerical method for solving complicated problems, nonlinear problems

64
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.980
Zeljko Ivezic: they are hard to solve.

65
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:42.010
Zeljko Ivezic: And then, finally, we will address the most important tool that bias and statistics gives us, and that is model selection.

66
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:47.230
Zeljko Ivezic: So you have some data. And now you have different ways of explaining.

67
00:19:47.820 --> 00:20:05.900
Zeljko Ivezic: Where is the data coming from? And so, when you have these different possibilities, the question is which one is the most possible or most probable, and that goes across the sciences, and we will learn how to do that, and we'll end up with probably the most useful

68
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:06.980
Zeljko Ivezic: methods

69
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:13.970
Zeljko Ivezic: in this first part of class called by using what algorithm it is essentially histogram maker.

70
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:18.310
Zeljko Ivezic: where it is intelligent enough to decide on its own

71
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:30.050
Zeljko Ivezic: how many pins you need, and how wide they have to be. So you don't have to specify in advance. I want 10 pins, or I might want my bill which to be this much. Just give it to the

72
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:38.230
Zeljko Ivezic: and magically it's not, Major, if you learn how it does it, and you get your histogram. That is statistically optimal meaning. You can't do better than that.

73
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:43.600
Zeljko Ivezic: So it is like the best method to know in the context of science and showing

74
00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.900
Zeljko Ivezic: and showing your results.

75
00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:55.920
Zeljko Ivezic: So at the zoom, since you all installed that space installation file and ran it. You know how to handle notebooks. Right?

76
00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:57.780
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay, Good.

77
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.840
Zeljko Ivezic: So let's keep that

78
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.290
Zeljko Ivezic: So

79
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.810
Zeljko Ivezic: How many of you took statistics before?

80
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.490
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay, cool?

81
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:21.540
Zeljko Ivezic: How many of you would be able to explain? I square what the skyscraper? Why is it useful.

82
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.930
Zeljko Ivezic: I'm not going to

83
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.470
Zeljko Ivezic: all right.

84
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:31.490
Zeljko Ivezic: so we'll we'll go through some nomenclature, and we'll learn

85
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:36.390
Zeljko Ivezic: about 5 square next time. But today just some gentle introduction.

86
00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.640
Zeljko Ivezic: So you know.

87
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.080
Zeljko Ivezic: we measured that. That's the

88
00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.230
Zeljko Ivezic: that's the

89
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.990
Zeljko Ivezic: just of science. Once you take the science, so let's assume

90
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.830
Zeljko Ivezic: we have some scale. I want to

91
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.640
Zeljko Ivezic: like. For example, we are going to measure temperature in this room.

92
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.110
Zeljko Ivezic: We are interested in

93
00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:04.280
Zeljko Ivezic: how the presence of humans in a lecture rope increases the temperature in the room, and how it involves its time.

94
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.260
Zeljko Ivezic: And so we are measuring the temperature.

95
00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:14.650
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now this is not a vector it's just a number we have, and single measurements, so we will call this

96
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:23.330
Zeljko Ivezic: X. I. Each individual number, let's say, in this room every 5 min for this hour we will measure temperature.

97
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.140
Zeljko Ivezic: so there will be series of numbers. and that's what we call

98
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.530
Zeljko Ivezic: X. I. In those curly brackets. This is all these measurements together.

99
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:44.010
Zeljko Ivezic: and now in practice. Sometimes you just paid these numbers with more than measurements. You also have some estimate of their uncertainty.

100
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:56.870
Zeljko Ivezic: Indeed, we will learn later if you just have that number. and you have absolutely no idea about the certainty of that number. You may as well throw that number to garbage.

101
00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:09.590
Zeljko Ivezic: You can't do anything with it. People do, because people always make underlying assumptions. But if you don't know anything, you can't do anything with it in practice this is basically

102
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:18.920
Zeljko Ivezic: hidden application of Bayesian statistics where you say, Well, I don't have errors on my temperature, but I will still plot it in a diagram. I'll still

103
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:26.640
Zeljko Ivezic: fit a line through it, because subconsciously, you are thinking Well, I know that my errors can't be

104
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:31.180
Zeljko Ivezic: 100. It means, I know that it's maybe plus minus one degree

105
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:37.880
Zeljko Ivezic: from experience, and then I have a range of 20 degree. So this finding errors are not

106
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:48.340
Zeljko Ivezic: influencing a lot by measurement. But that's something that often we don't explicitly say, but it's hidden in the analysis. so we will see examples later.

107
00:23:49.270 --> 00:24:05.080
Zeljko Ivezic: So now there is another thing we could also be saying, Well, just at a given moment in this room when I measure temperature, I'm. Concerned about the distribution of the temperature in this room. So instead of one thermometer, I'll put like 100 of them.

108
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:10.930
Zeljko Ivezic: Every each of you will have one little thermometer that we mentioned temperature that your position.

109
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:17.860
Zeljko Ivezic: and then I will have set of this measurement, and I will be asking what distribution it was drawn from.

110
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:30.280
Zeljko Ivezic: One possibility is that temperature is the same everywhere in this room, and all of you should be getting the same answer to within the piston on certain things, and they learn what that means

111
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.900
Zeljko Ivezic: mathematical form.

112
00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:48.900
Zeljko Ivezic: And so what we are asking is, what is the underlying distribution. So in some of the lectures we'll call this distribution Age of X. It would be some Gaussian distribution. It would be box function. It would be delta function doesn't matter. That's some true distribution

113
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:54.220
Zeljko Ivezic: from which we draw this data. and that's known only

114
00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:03.060
Zeljko Ivezic: to supreme links. We will never know this, because we can never measure without so. But fundamentally, that's what we are trying to do.

115
00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.410
Zeljko Ivezic: So we'll call this age effects.

116
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:11.040
Zeljko Ivezic: and there's basically probability that your measurement will be in some interval

117
00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.990
Zeljko Ivezic: given by the value plus something to this amount. The Dx.

118
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:31.500
Zeljko Ivezic: When we try to estimate age of X. We will call it F. Of X. That's a data based estimate. So you assume that you are measuring a Gauss that your underlying distribution is Gaussian, or, you know, for some reason.

119
00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:45.640
Zeljko Ivezic: And then basically for Gaussian distribution, we'll see numerical example later. You need to know 2 numbers. You need to know location, and you need to know how wide it is. And now, with your data set, you're trying to estimate those full numbers.

120
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:53.880
Zeljko Ivezic: and unless your data set is infinitely large. You cannot perfectly well estimate these 2 numbers.

121
00:25:54.360 --> 00:26:08.820
Zeljko Ivezic: So whatever you do, since you don't have infinite data set. Whatever you do with it, there will be some uncertainties, and that's what we want to learn. How do we treat these uncertainties and what once i'm given this data Set X. I. In curly brackets.

122
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.630
Zeljko Ivezic: and they do some magic to get Gaussian

123
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:23.370
Zeljko Ivezic: best fit parameters. What is my uncertainty for those parameters like? If you had to make a bet, if your life depended on it like. If it was reliability of a parish.

124
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:36.510
Zeljko Ivezic: you would be concerned very well about what is your confidence? Limit? What is probability, etc. Or if you want to make bets in economics, you would want to understand what is the probability that you are right.

125
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:50.780
Zeljko Ivezic: So to shorten this introduction. So basically most of this class will be about estimating the distribution function. In the beginning we will be handling one dimension of this.

126
00:26:51.140 --> 00:27:00.810
Zeljko Ivezic: but by the end of class we will learn how to handle 10,000 dimensional distribution function and what to do. How do we do that in practice.

127
00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:08.260
Zeljko Ivezic: like, for example, when Netflix is fine, to predict what kind of movie you would like.

128
00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:15.710
Zeljko Ivezic: They are operating with few 1,000 variables. and they are doing predictions, using methods that we learn at the end of this class.

129
00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.710
Zeljko Ivezic: Are we good, so far anyone to make

130
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.670
Zeljko Ivezic: all right.

131
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.100
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is brief introduction to probability.

132
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:39.930
Zeljko Ivezic: because we need these rules to understand the and the commission of the that we will be talking about next time.

133
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:47.540
Zeljko Ivezic: We will go quickly through today. This is all basic stuff, you probably know before, but just to remind you.

134
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:55.130
Zeljko Ivezic: So if we have 2 events, we call event a something by probability, that's tomorrow correctly.

135
00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.510
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's some probability between 0 and one.

136
00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.490
Zeljko Ivezic: And let's event it can be. Am I going to come

137
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:13.510
Zeljko Ivezic: to my office tomorrow and this probability? And now, if i'm dedicated researcher, and I can't do my work. You respect your brain.

138
00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.600
Zeljko Ivezic: Then there is no overlap between 2

139
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:23.700
Zeljko Ivezic: and the

140
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:35.240
Zeljko Ivezic: and does not depend on what about the. On the other hand, if I do not come to office where it's ready.

141
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:42.380
Zeljko Ivezic: then these 2 will be power. So in general. So these are 2 extreme cases

142
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:48.610
Zeljko Ivezic: in general probability, that both of these events will happen. If this you stand for union.

143
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:52.150
Zeljko Ivezic: it's probability of each of them.

144
00:28:52.530 --> 00:29:01.680
Zeljko Ivezic: But you can see from this geometric representation that in the middle, when we add these 2 circles, we are counting that region twice.

145
00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.860
Zeljko Ivezic: so probability of the outer edge.

146
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:12.740
Zeljko Ivezic: Is there some of the circles, but I need to subtract one of those 2 on double account.

147
00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.360
Zeljko Ivezic: So probability of the union of 2 events

148
00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:22.860
Zeljko Ivezic: is the sum of their probabilities, minus the probability that both will happen.

149
00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:37.430
Zeljko Ivezic: and each of these probabilities is limited to 0 and one, and it can prove. But if these 2 are limited to 0 to one, and this one is guaranteed to be 0 to one. So that's basic of probability that comes directly from geometry.

150
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.450
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is now

151
00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.320
Zeljko Ivezic: one important thing on top.

152
00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:50.320
Zeljko Ivezic: and then there is concept of conditional probability.

153
00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:57.640
Zeljko Ivezic: What is the probability that both of these will happen? So this is now. So let's say again.

154
00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:02.950
Zeljko Ivezic: A is probability that I will come to office.

155
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:08.340
Zeljko Ivezic: and B is the probability that it will write it tomorrow.

156
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:18.700
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now you can say probability that both will happen is the probability that one will happen, like probability, that it will rain tomorrow.

157
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:28.960
Zeljko Ivezic: Times the probability of the other invent condition on this one. so it is not just probability I will be in the office, but it is probability that I will come to office.

158
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:32.150
Zeljko Ivezic: Given that I already know it's rainy.

159
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.800
Zeljko Ivezic: so I condition that probability on the other one.

160
00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:43.300
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's called conditional probability. It's symmetric in these 2 events. If you replace a and B. Then you get the same expression.

161
00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:52.800
Zeljko Ivezic: and by generalizing this we come to this law of total probability. That is

162
00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:59.760
Zeljko Ivezic: also later very important, because we will be using it to expand the space of possibilities.

163
00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.880
Zeljko Ivezic: So let's say, now

164
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:09.470
Zeljko Ivezic: I think I saw this one from my colleague, because it's talking about both people. It's like.

165
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.370
Zeljko Ivezic: So he expanded this. And

166
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:19.200
Zeljko Ivezic: what is the probability that when you enter the classroom you will see your head on the door.

167
00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:24.150
Zeljko Ivezic: So he expanded this into 3.

168
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:29.510
Zeljko Ivezic: Of course you could do for me, at least, that that 3 categories of people

169
00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.600
Zeljko Ivezic: that's all like Mario.

170
00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:41.210
Zeljko Ivezic: Then there are hours. People like this, and then and now, what is the probability? You will hit your head

171
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:47.630
Zeljko Ivezic: is probability you don't hit your head if you are tall probability to hit you that if your average

172
00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.720
Zeljko Ivezic: and probability to hit you, and if you are short

173
00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.720
Zeljko Ivezic: now, let's assume you can be stupid, and you can start jumping.

174
00:31:55.590 --> 00:32:02.990
Zeljko Ivezic: Now let's assume if you are short, you can't jump. Test 5 to hit your head. So this probability it becomes 0.

175
00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:15.170
Zeljko Ivezic: Let's say, if your coverage fight, you have probability of 10. You can jump high enough to beat your head. So we set this one to point 1

176
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:19.850
Zeljko Ivezic: and probability that you hit your pad if you are tall.

177
00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:25.140
Zeljko Ivezic: and the Toller and the Lord let's say they put it to one or 90.9,

178
00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:29.520
Zeljko Ivezic: because if you have a response, you can bend over and get it.

179
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:33.840
Zeljko Ivezic: So basically that this

180
00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:41.520
Zeljko Ivezic: and if you want to compute the final probability, that's the magic, you're just summing all the conditional probabilities

181
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:48.760
Zeljko Ivezic: so like what will happen tomorrow if you're talking about who will be in the office?

182
00:32:48.950 --> 00:33:03.840
Zeljko Ivezic: You can say probability for this person to come off. This is that much, and then go over all the people that are in that office? If your question is, will anyone be tomorrow in that office. So basically we expand possibilities and sum it up.

183
00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:15.420
Zeljko Ivezic: And so here. one other thing to emphasize is that sometimes the notation is confusing.

184
00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:21.330
Zeljko Ivezic: and we will use common. But all these 4 you can find in the Internet recording textbook.

185
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:31.590
Zeljko Ivezic: So when you find some constant. it can be very confusing because people are not standardizing their notation.

186
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.700
Zeljko Ivezic: And so, finally.

187
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.610
Zeljko Ivezic: so, if we have 2 events

188
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:50.770
Zeljko Ivezic: not dependent on each other than the probability of the Board

189
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:56.010
Zeljko Ivezic: is only the product of their probabilities. And so here is example

190
00:33:56.310 --> 00:34:00.050
Zeljko Ivezic: on this.

191
00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:07.330
Zeljko Ivezic: and I like ready. Do this to add anything to do with each other. Okay.

192
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:12.120
Zeljko Ivezic: unless I was little the they need to use it, but they did not.

193
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.130
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's the idea. So when you have totally uncorrelated

194
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:20.360
Zeljko Ivezic: events. and just

195
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.760
Zeljko Ivezic: but in that condition that you cannot do that.

196
00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:27.070
Zeljko Ivezic: And so this simple example was designed

197
00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:35.090
Zeljko Ivezic: to give you the both possibilities in the same exam. So say you have a back with 5 models.

198
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:39.840
Zeljko Ivezic: 5 ball and 3.

199
00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:47.310
Zeljko Ivezic: And now you put your hand here. You draw one. Then you put your P in the in the 0 s.

200
00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:53.110
Zeljko Ivezic: and what is the probability that you build it to yellow marble?

201
00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:54.699
Zeljko Ivezic: 1, 55.

202
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.480
Zeljko Ivezic: So the

203
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:06.790
Zeljko Ivezic: that probability of these 2 events, what happening the first time I'll be able to go, and then second time I will get here. All again

204
00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:10.920
Zeljko Ivezic: is the probability that they will get you over.

205
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.310
Zeljko Ivezic: and then

206
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:25.150
Zeljko Ivezic: probability that I will get yellow for second time. Given that I've already not hoped that the first time You' the first of all

207
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:37.480
Zeljko Ivezic: and number of times together, you have so called, send it without the so I just. or it's always the same back

208
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:43.880
Zeljko Ivezic: now.

209
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:51.510
Zeljko Ivezic: Well, it's just an example. In reality

210
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:07.010
Zeljko Ivezic: you can.

211
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:10.050
Zeljko Ivezic: So now let me. Be. One

212
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:15.740
Zeljko Ivezic: probability is three-fifth, because they are to evolve with the that's easy.

213
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:21.590
Zeljko Ivezic: but the difference comes from the second step. So if I put it back

214
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:26.030
Zeljko Ivezic: if I did not put it back

215
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:37.980
Zeljko Ivezic: so because I did not put the ball back. So I get one result.

216
00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:44.830
Zeljko Ivezic: But now I assume that I actually replace the ball and try it again. Now the probability

217
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:59.600
Zeljko Ivezic: it's 3. Fifth, because I and it's exactly the same, because I have accepted the same call, and there is obviously. And so, when we applied to the actual measurement more involved models, we need to understand

218
00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:04.400
Zeljko Ivezic: this relationship. We will have repeated statistical sampling.

219
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:07.710
Zeljko Ivezic: We'll measure something with some uncertainties.

220
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:14.720
Zeljko Ivezic: and we need to know if my second measurement it depends on what I did in the first measure.

221
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:26.690
Zeljko Ivezic: or if my end measurement depends on N minus one measure. this is crucial piece of information. When we develop statistical model and conceptual is not more

222
00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:30.600
Zeljko Ivezic: complicated, then then this exam.

223
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.270
Zeljko Ivezic: And here is another

224
00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:42.170
Zeljko Ivezic: visual example from Joe Bobby's class is a strong number at University of Toronto.

225
00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:54.200
Zeljko Ivezic: We have also has very, very nice class, which is more a in statistics than these lectures. But if you're interested in the refreshing your knowledge of statistics, then i'd highly recommend to you.

226
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:59.550
Zeljko Ivezic: It's a link. When you download Github, you can go there.

227
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.090
Zeljko Ivezic: So let me see.

228
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.580
Zeljko Ivezic: Is this visible? Okay?

229
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:16.120
Zeljko Ivezic: So his example is, what is the probability? They both a and B. Those app. So each event

230
00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:26.590
Zeljko Ivezic: it's called something a, B and C, and there is some overlap between them. And so these stars, the purple stars show

231
00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:41.710
Zeljko Ivezic: the realization of something. and that sounds like some measurement. Okay, then. conditions to be in need to be set. So some stars are outside of everything but one is the lower right.

232
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.120
Zeljko Ivezic: Some start

233
00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:46.470
Zeljko Ivezic: 2 or 3 conditions.

234
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:53.790
Zeljko Ivezic: And so, if you, what is probability that what a and B look at

235
00:38:54.020 --> 00:39:00.550
Zeljko Ivezic: that means. What is the probability that the star is in all the left of a and B.

236
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.520
Zeljko Ivezic: You can see the 3 start

237
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:06.240
Zeljko Ivezic: conditioned on.

238
00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:13.570
Zeljko Ivezic: and let's see on the fact that they start is already in the C.

239
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.840
Zeljko Ivezic: And so, if you will, by I, you see to be start.

240
00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:24.020
Zeljko Ivezic: How many do we have? 3, 7, 1013, 56, and 70.

241
00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:35.520
Zeljko Ivezic: That's 17. So probability to land in in in that in our portion it's 3, but you can also get it.

242
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:42.110
Zeljko Ivezic: If I come to start, you can also get it in a different way. You can expand. Now.

243
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:54.370
Zeljko Ivezic: This you can say: Remember that you said probability of a and B happening the first 2. What's one circle? What's the other circle?

244
00:39:56.730 --> 00:40:01.400
Zeljko Ivezic: In this case it's exactly the same, except it's so.

245
00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:05.590
Zeljko Ivezic: So if we know that stock we can see.

246
00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:19.660
Zeljko Ivezic: Then you can expand it in probabilities that probability that you are in a, if you are on C, and so on, and that now takes care of this one and this one over there.

247
00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:27.540
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you only look at stars in those 2 over there, so the 4 that are not in C, so we come down to 13.

248
00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:30.680
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you know that you are in C,

249
00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:43.280
Zeljko Ivezic: then probability of a given that you are in c. Is these 8 stars in a 8 out of 13, and the same for B. The 6, I believe. Now 8,

250
00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:55.240
Zeljko Ivezic: 1234560, those 2 are not in C, so 6 over 13, and then minus this 3 overl, so that totally 2 different place to get to the same detail.

251
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:56.930
Zeljko Ivezic: We can test.

252
00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:06.390
Zeljko Ivezic: Do that side, but then you can expand it in much simpler returns, and that's the key. Why are we bothering with this theoretical stuff.

253
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:11.220
Zeljko Ivezic: because when we get to making models of the real events we are measured.

254
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:18.560
Zeljko Ivezic: then things will get complicated. And if you know how to separate complicated problem

255
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:26.310
Zeljko Ivezic: that you don't know how to solve into many simple problems that you do know how to solve. That is the recipe

256
00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:35.320
Zeljko Ivezic: in this context. So we? That's always what we want in science to separate, to split complex problems that are

257
00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:41.160
Zeljko Ivezic: probably not soluble into a set of very simple problems that we have tools to solve.

258
00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:49.990
Zeljko Ivezic: All right. So this is all of the same.

259
00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.260
Zeljko Ivezic: And now we come to the

260
00:41:53.580 --> 00:42:06.940
Zeljko Ivezic: continuous version of this, and this will be ingredient for talking about and statistics later. But at this point it has nothing to do with it by using the statistics directly it's basically probability.

261
00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:08.820
Zeljko Ivezic: So

262
00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:21.570
Zeljko Ivezic: this is now change of the patient. So, instead of playing with the set of discrete events, but the ABC. I speech, notation. And now we are thinking about continuous distribution.

263
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:28.730
Zeljko Ivezic: So we cannot say that the probability, if you up, maybe I should go first. For example.

264
00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:35.100
Zeljko Ivezic: if you're thinking of probability as a two-dimensional function, let me start by. Explain the speaker.

265
00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:44.150
Zeljko Ivezic: so you can see in the top, in the left panel, in the top right corner there is some great banana.

266
00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:58.270
Zeljko Ivezic: so the banana is punishment of full coordinates X and Y, and where it start when you see the banana, that is the probability density

267
00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:10.680
Zeljko Ivezic: and that probability density is coded on the right hand side in gray state. So if you now take all this pixel that that call it in great, you take these numbers, you add them up.

268
00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:12.530
Zeljko Ivezic: you will get one.

269
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:19.090
Zeljko Ivezic: Multiply by the pixel. You'll get one. In other words, the integral of the

270
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.440
Zeljko Ivezic: that is

271
00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:34.660
Zeljko Ivezic: properly normalized probability distribution. And this is now function of 2 coordinates X and Y. It is no dimension of probability distribution.

272
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:43.060
Zeljko Ivezic: Now imagine that I didn't know when I measured. That's that's cool, right

273
00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:55.510
Zeljko Ivezic: Like, for example, this picture that we talked about. I didn't know that. Actually the value of the temperature also depends on the faster in this room.

274
00:43:55.730 --> 00:44:07.790
Zeljko Ivezic: and maybe humidity another. I was just focusing on temperature. I didn't know anything about the other. and so, if that temperature was axe. this probability distribution

275
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:11.520
Zeljko Ivezic: to me it would look like this histogram in the bottom.

276
00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:15.500
Zeljko Ivezic: It's roughly a lot more about distribution.

277
00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:17.660
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you don't know

278
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:31.030
Zeljko Ivezic: anything about it, and you focus on this one while it's one dimensional distribution, and that is in this case what we call marching on. So we integrate over the other 1, 60,

279
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.520
Zeljko Ivezic: and we get marginalized distribution.

280
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:37.220
Zeljko Ivezic: So it is probability

281
00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:43.580
Zeljko Ivezic: of X. Given that you know nothing about. Why.

282
00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:51.540
Zeljko Ivezic: but what do you do if you know nothing about one, but we just integrate over all those situations. That's what the formula says.

283
00:44:52.090 --> 00:45:01.490
Zeljko Ivezic: So given that we don't know anything about Why, we just say every possible value for a given X. We take every possible value in this diagram, add them up

284
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:13.520
Zeljko Ivezic: because we don't know anything about. We have to take all assumptions into account, all the sorry possibilities into the account, and that integration is called marginalization.

285
00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:19.380
Zeljko Ivezic: And then also, now we can clearly see the concept of conditional capability.

286
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:31.610
Zeljko Ivezic: So what is the probability of X. What is this distribution in the bottom panel? We see this distribution, if we have no information about one.

287
00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:39.270
Zeljko Ivezic: But let's say we did know that the results are dependent on why, and we measured it, or the unknown.

288
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.780
Zeljko Ivezic: It's no some other sources.

289
00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:47.900
Zeljko Ivezic: If you now fixed why, and that 3 examples: blue ring and red.

290
00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:55.300
Zeljko Ivezic: If you fix, why then the distribution changes. The 2 are correlated. They are not independent.

291
00:45:55.350 --> 00:46:06.060
Zeljko Ivezic: So if y is blue, then it will be shifted to what right? If Y is in the right slice, it will be shifted to the left, and these histograms on the right

292
00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.890
Zeljko Ivezic: so also.

293
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:12.930
Zeljko Ivezic: but now it's condition on Why?

294
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:16.760
Zeljko Ivezic: So? What is shown in the right.

295
00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:22.960
Zeljko Ivezic: hey? Now are these probabilities? Probability of X given one?

296
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.860
Zeljko Ivezic: That's what is managed by this start.

297
00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:29.910
Zeljko Ivezic: Take 2 dimensional distribution, fix Y,

298
00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.990
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you will get your conditional distribution.

299
00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:45.610
Zeljko Ivezic: Why is that important? It's important? Because if I now have these conditional distributions, then I can recover the black distribution of

300
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:58.650
Zeljko Ivezic: X irrespective of Why, if I just now integrate this so for each of these basically these all histograms you can imagine. Now, convenience distribution. I have to add them all up.

301
00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:03.260
Zeljko Ivezic: But I need to wage them by the probability of why.

302
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:06.070
Zeljko Ivezic: and that probability of why

303
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:17.380
Zeljko Ivezic: changes along banana. It goes from low probability. You can see from the left side there is maximum with the banana is the darkest, and then it goes again to all.

304
00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:22.200
Zeljko Ivezic: So in this 2 dimensional case this explains the concept of

305
00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.530
Zeljko Ivezic: marginal and conditional probabilities.

306
00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:32.790
Zeljko Ivezic: and then

307
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:43.100
Zeljko Ivezic: the useful thing that comes out of it is so. The

308
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:59.380
Zeljko Ivezic: And now we can say one term. one conditional probability, one side, and move the other one to the right. So if I pay. if I take the right hand side.

309
00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:07.180
Zeljko Ivezic: I take probability of y given X on the left side. I can then simply move the effects on the other side, and I have the first, third.

310
00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.320
Zeljko Ivezic: and then

311
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:18.370
Zeljko Ivezic: we know from the law of common probabilities. We talked about that I can write the effects as we actually in the ground of the top one.

312
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:30.450
Zeljko Ivezic: And so this single manipulation. this is the probably most important in all of the business today.

313
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.690
Zeljko Ivezic: This is basically giving you

314
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.860
Zeljko Ivezic: theoretical.

315
00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:44.760
Zeljko Ivezic: And later we'll see that this is not just in the context of measurements it has to do with. For example

316
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:57.070
Zeljko Ivezic: in the they are using the same equation in law to assess probability, for example, that someone who is murder stuff that actually murdered someone if they had DNA.

317
00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:00.020
Zeljko Ivezic: It comes also in

318
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:11.080
Zeljko Ivezic: in economics where you have some model, and you need to create what will happen in the future. This stuff, and it's all based on this

319
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.220
Zeljko Ivezic: inversion. So here X. You think of it as data.

320
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.760
Zeljko Ivezic: and why with model.

321
00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:21.600
Zeljko Ivezic: And so, if I want to know what is the probability one month.

322
00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:24.480
Zeljko Ivezic: You know that I had some data.

323
00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:32.490
Zeljko Ivezic: Then this formula tells you it's given by the

324
00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:37.910
Zeljko Ivezic: It's been more than that. You don't know it more than it.

325
00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:45.200
Zeljko Ivezic: So there's the key there, that's what's called like you. and then deal why.

326
00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:49.180
Zeljko Ivezic: probability of model. if you don't know anything.

327
00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:52.390
Zeljko Ivezic: and that probability is all right.

328
00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:59.500
Zeljko Ivezic: and we'll see same, for when you actually know something about the process, even if you not didn't do anything

329
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:03.560
Zeljko Ivezic: so like. If you ask me what is the

330
00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:06.980
Zeljko Ivezic: yeah? Most surely

331
00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:10.690
Zeljko Ivezic: it is not here, because the

332
00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.650
Zeljko Ivezic: and it's less than 100, because it' before.

333
00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.440
Zeljko Ivezic: So

334
00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:43.870
Zeljko Ivezic: So at this point it is still, it is just a simple result from probability theory, based on nothing more complicated than those.

335
00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:52.750
Zeljko Ivezic: But later, if we generalize it to this model, we Don't have extremely powerful tool in our tool.

336
00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:58.890
Zeljko Ivezic: So if all this sounds like too much theory, and you got most along the way.

337
00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:10.000
Zeljko Ivezic: it is super super important that for the next time go again through all these words, read them and take through it. Sometimes it may sound very trivial.

338
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:20.950
Zeljko Ivezic: but the team is at this moment. It is not video. It's complicated, and you have to.

339
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:25.750
Zeljko Ivezic: And at that point you have been ready to continue with it.

340
00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:35.780
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay, few more details. We have about half. We have what it is like, 1115 to.

341
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:48.540
Zeljko Ivezic: So okay, we are just halfway through. Excellent. So here is another interesting. interesting example of so called contingency table

342
00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:51.710
Zeljko Ivezic: that will be interesting to

343
00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:54.450
Zeljko Ivezic: everyone, including

344
00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:01.020
Zeljko Ivezic: biology and chemistry, etc.,

345
00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:04.630
Zeljko Ivezic: astronomers. This applies to everyone.

346
00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:10.570
Zeljko Ivezic: and this is now basically application of this formula Here.

347
00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:14.680
Zeljko Ivezic: How do we invert data into

348
00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:17.360
Zeljko Ivezic: assessment of model?

349
00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:25.070
Zeljko Ivezic: And so let's say.

350
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:27.520
Zeljko Ivezic: and you

351
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.570
Zeljko Ivezic: or this is bad. You're pregnant.

352
00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:33.230
Zeljko Ivezic: and you'll take privacy.

353
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:37.040
Zeljko Ivezic: or you will suspect

354
00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.340
Zeljko Ivezic: you may not anything

355
00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:44.410
Zeljko Ivezic: what that will be best

356
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:54.240
Zeljko Ivezic: i'm in.

357
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.850
Okay.

358
00:52:56.460 --> 00:53:03.440
Zeljko Ivezic: these are all exactly the same.

359
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:07.840
Zeljko Ivezic: So you take this and the

360
00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:13.310
Zeljko Ivezic: it's either. And this test is not.

361
00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:15.560
Zeljko Ivezic: It can be one positive

362
00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:25.460
Zeljko Ivezic: and there and then also. you can have a disease. Here we are talking about Covid. or

363
00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:33.850
Zeljko Ivezic: you could be real murderer, or you would be pregnant. In that case it's not the cease. But this is data. And so the data is positive.

364
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:40.050
Zeljko Ivezic: If beta is true of something, we'll call it one, and if it's not, it's 0,

365
00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:43.530
Zeljko Ivezic: and so now we have 4 possible.

366
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.420
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you take

367
00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.620
Zeljko Ivezic: it doesn't necessarily mean that you have a phone.

368
00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.240
Zeljko Ivezic: because no.

369
00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:58.970
Zeljko Ivezic: and I think it's the most.

370
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:07.900
Zeljko Ivezic: And then

371
00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:15.680
Zeljko Ivezic: or in time, it can be like 8 months. So we know.

372
00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:21.270
Zeljko Ivezic: alright, and that's what we summarize with these 4,

373
00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.110
Zeljko Ivezic: and then

374
00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:29.110
Zeljko Ivezic: we will quantify them. We will introduce some things that we assume unknown.

375
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:35.310
Zeljko Ivezic: So we know all these conditional no numbers.

376
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:41.380
Zeljko Ivezic: So what is the probability that you have?

377
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:46.390
Zeljko Ivezic: But you are not.

378
00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:52.660
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's measured on a number of known bases before they put it best for the market

379
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:56.490
Zeljko Ivezic: and your support to know this number

380
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:04.570
Zeljko Ivezic: that we are talking about here.

381
00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:11.340
Zeljko Ivezic: So I right, i'm. So you know it's negative.

382
00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:18.780
Zeljko Ivezic: and these are.

383
00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:26.420
Zeljko Ivezic: And then, of course, obviously, these are your

384
00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:31.160
Zeljko Ivezic: So these are my meetings. You get the call it test, and you tell me.

385
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:36.930
Zeljko Ivezic: and

386
00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:44.300
Zeljko Ivezic: for the same, let's say.

387
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.460
Zeljko Ivezic: let's say you have the

388
00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:57.240
Zeljko Ivezic: i'm certain, and the that person who's DNA too, actually

389
00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:10.090
Zeljko Ivezic: you have the but now this is for even DNA just to make mistakes. So you don't get such 2 numbers. The mark will be exactly the same.

390
00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:15.050
Zeljko Ivezic: And so we summarize this in this matrix

391
00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:20.480
Zeljko Ivezic: that's input. And what we want to know is

392
00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:27.820
Zeljko Ivezic: like If i'm testing positive on that test, what is the actual chance

393
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:44.110
Zeljko Ivezic: is the breast cancer. You don't do test. The test is lousy, and it has very fine, and you can do the same calculation to ask yourself

394
00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:53.270
Zeljko Ivezic: if I know

395
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:54.460
I

396
00:56:54.830 --> 00:57:05.970
Zeljko Ivezic: and the last number, of course, is the So let's say

397
00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:19.810
Zeljko Ivezic: so. We not having any data with any tests. we still And now I take this other number 79. What

398
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:25.750
Zeljko Ivezic: So if I that positive I cannot seem to say the fourth

399
00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:34.550
Zeljko Ivezic: both the rate 2%. So I have 98% of the ability. They can say that's incorrect calculation.

400
00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:39.390
Zeljko Ivezic: So, using that conditional probability that we had before

401
00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:44.990
Zeljko Ivezic: the one that had X and 1 one X from before just different names. Now

402
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:47.650
Zeljko Ivezic: probability that I have this

403
00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:54.000
Zeljko Ivezic: given that my test is positive is given by this and bright expression, that 3 times.

404
00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:55.600
Zeljko Ivezic: and this sounds combined.

405
00:57:56.050 --> 00:58:10.850
Zeljko Ivezic: so there's nothing different than what we did before we those sets and probabilities in X and Y, and they exactly the same. It's just not. It's not picture, because the client gets to a very specific case.

406
00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:15.660
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now for the the what, the

407
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:31.610
Zeljko Ivezic: the nuclear it's just more. I get this expression, we said. We know for test. For that it falls positive, and we know the probability of that condition of the disease without any data is given by X, one B,

408
00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:42.310
Zeljko Ivezic: because tests usually have these numbers that are small, or they wouldn't be called best. We can do some approximations. When we multiply 2 small numbers.

409
00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:50.340
Zeljko Ivezic: it neglect them. So you can simplify this expression to the last expression, and that's the key result.

410
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:53.700
Zeljko Ivezic: So probability that by next call it

411
00:58:57.670 --> 00:59:03.390
Zeljko Ivezic: is not one minus 4 supposed to be right as you would.

412
00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.990
Zeljko Ivezic: The correct result is the ratio

413
00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:16.720
Zeljko Ivezic: it's the ratio of probability of divided by the sum of these 2.

414
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:22.830
Zeljko Ivezic: And now let's let's think little bit about this. So

415
00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:30.480
Zeljko Ivezic: if all supposed to be great is 0,

416
00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:41.130
Zeljko Ivezic: then this probability is one nominator. What? Because it's some need money, and it reduces with the other one.

417
00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:44.160
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you have.

418
00:59:45.450 --> 00:59:48.390
Zeljko Ivezic: then this probability on the left hand side

419
00:59:48.790 --> 00:59:53.820
Zeljko Ivezic: it's just one. If your test said you had call it, and the test is perfect.

420
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:55.740
Zeljko Ivezic: You get a call.

421
00:59:55.770 --> 01:00:00.480
Zeljko Ivezic: It doesn't matter. Okay, one.

422
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:09.240
Zeljko Ivezic: Oh.

423
01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:22.150
Zeljko Ivezic: if the fourth positive rate he's much.

424
01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:32.790
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's a number by the so much, much much smaller than one.

425
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:36.580
Zeljko Ivezic: So basically it tells you your

426
01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.520
Zeljko Ivezic: So the

427
01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.630
Zeljko Ivezic: compares to the

428
01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:48.870
Zeljko Ivezic: very good.

429
01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:55.190
Zeljko Ivezic: So yeah, this is a good question. But how do we

430
01:00:55.270 --> 01:01:08.490
Zeljko Ivezic: people the?

431
01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:36.880
Zeljko Ivezic: That's a nice, so that's not directly included in this model. We assume that these are uncorrelated, but you could change it and say, I'm only considered a certain type of people that you just described, and i'm giving you both. Possibly.

432
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:45.340
Zeljko Ivezic: So you can combine it in this numbers. But this model is much simpler than what we said, which is that we would really need to combine that this.

433
01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.420
Zeljko Ivezic: this.

434
01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:59.740
Zeljko Ivezic: or if I could just be out and say, let's think of a simple problems like, for example, if you are a murder, suspect, then you don't really what it is in that quote

435
01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.710
Zeljko Ivezic: So it

436
01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.150
Zeljko Ivezic: in reality

437
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:08.140
that

438
01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:11.300
Okay.

439
01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:23.400
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is the conclusion. And now, what is going on? Why is it so? So? Now we'll let's just do numerical example.

440
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:30.540
Zeljko Ivezic: So let's say that we have a

441
01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:37.760
Zeljko Ivezic: and we assumed that the probability of the

442
01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:42.850
Zeljko Ivezic: so we immediately know that in those 1,000 people

443
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.090
Zeljko Ivezic: we Don't have to tend to.

444
01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:50.680
Zeljko Ivezic: but we also know that phone supposed to be great.

445
01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:52.930
Zeljko Ivezic: It's not very.

446
01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:56.080
Zeljko Ivezic: And so if I

447
01:02:56.450 --> 01:03:01.290
Zeljko Ivezic: I will get 20,

448
01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:03.340
Zeljko Ivezic: not because people are really safe.

449
01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:11.120
Zeljko Ivezic: like 10,000 people. I get 30. It wasn't the best

450
01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:16.270
Zeljko Ivezic: and only one. I get the

451
01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:20.010
Zeljko Ivezic: one for 33.

452
01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:23.540
Zeljko Ivezic: So this because

453
01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.690
Zeljko Ivezic: So again, You' us to

454
01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:33.640
Zeljko Ivezic: naively that it just both right. Now let's say

455
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:37.130
Zeljko Ivezic: you can.

456
01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:41.070
Zeljko Ivezic: and unless the

457
01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:49.870
Zeljko Ivezic: is smaller than the

458
01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:51.290
Zeljko Ivezic: you don't have to.

459
01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.620
Zeljko Ivezic: But if they, the kind of

460
01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:59.940
Zeljko Ivezic: you, go out with it

461
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:10.800
Zeljko Ivezic: from the

462
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:19.250
Zeljko Ivezic: it.

463
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:25.910
Zeljko Ivezic: and it's not easy to have the animation.

464
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:28.340
Zeljko Ivezic: Yeah.

465
01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:35.080
Zeljko Ivezic: So very often people especially

466
01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:42.500
Zeljko Ivezic: use. They have literally. very often people are

467
01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:52.040
Zeljko Ivezic: so even in this context, or to

468
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:55.700
Zeljko Ivezic: this

469
01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.670
Zeljko Ivezic: judicial.

470
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:09.010
Zeljko Ivezic: And indeed, there was recently studied by the Us. National Academy of sciences

471
01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:16.840
Zeljko Ivezic: that show that 4%, about 40% of people put to death in the United States.

472
01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:18.850
Zeljko Ivezic: That's probably an email sign.

473
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:25.830
Zeljko Ivezic: and the result Why, the jury is convinced they were guilty, was the statistic of.

474
01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:29.500
Zeljko Ivezic: And also, if you go, have a test

475
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:32.520
Zeljko Ivezic: for something serious like, for example.

476
01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:36.200
Zeljko Ivezic: breast cancer, and to get positive tests. Don't panic

477
01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:39.860
Zeljko Ivezic: find this number to calculation, and maybe it's all good.

478
01:05:40.830 --> 01:05:46.680
Zeljko Ivezic: So i'll stop here before we go to the last

479
01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:50.370
Zeljko Ivezic: again. When you see this stuff for the first time

480
01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.520
Zeljko Ivezic: may sound very complicated.

481
01:05:52.610 --> 01:06:03.340
Zeljko Ivezic: My! If you go little by little to this steps in piece of your own home you can play, and it's same part in this in the very simple, but very

482
01:06:05.070 --> 01:06:07.530
Zeljko Ivezic: so by 2 continuous okay, please.

483
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:27.690
Zeljko Ivezic: you can imagine you have 2 dimensional.

484
01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:33.170
Zeljko Ivezic: but it has to be a line X. In this case

485
01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:42.300
Zeljko Ivezic: you get the same distribution. It's an organization, but it's always the

486
01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:49.020
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay, let me continue.

487
01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:54.800
Zeljko Ivezic: So. The most important distribution that we will use. He's Gaussian.

488
01:06:55.250 --> 01:07:00.320
Zeljko Ivezic: It's everywhere, and large fraction of classical statistics is based

489
01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:03.650
Zeljko Ivezic: on that distribution. I presume you all know what it is.

490
01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:11.450
Zeljko Ivezic: This is formula. Everybody should know it in the middle of the night. So this is one thing. You'll center it on me. There's the location.

491
01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:23.210
Zeljko Ivezic: The Sigma is the weight of the distribution, and this stuff in front comes from the requirements that it's integral over X must be one that's normalization constant.

492
01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:31.870
Zeljko Ivezic: So it's normal or Gaussian distribution. Here is few values of Sigma shown on this diagram.

493
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:51.170
Zeljko Ivezic: One other thing to remember is that when you integrate this, and often we have to integrate these distributions to get overall probability. It's not analytic for Gaussian, and in dark ages we use tables where you would see what is the integral these days you just use sci-fi function

494
01:07:51.170 --> 01:08:07.620
Zeljko Ivezic: in your python code, and it tells you the result of this integral for any for any value. So now we come to this part that will. I didn't know how many of you were familiar with python and notebook. So I put very simple example, and

495
01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:17.109
Zeljko Ivezic: where we just show how to take in this case Gaussian distribution. But in general you can do anyone. So this norm

496
01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:23.210
Zeljko Ivezic: so in sci-fi starts. We import normal distribution.

497
01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:28.090
Zeljko Ivezic: Now, if you google it and you go to the web page for for stats from site 5

498
01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:35.080
Zeljko Ivezic: side by stands for scientific python. If you go there and look at their documentation. You can see they are

499
01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.819
Zeljko Ivezic: almost 100 different distributions you can call. So we just in

500
01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:45.270
Zeljko Ivezic: basically this line says. give me the tools to handle Gaussian distribution.

501
01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:49.580
Zeljko Ivezic: and so then we can call this norm.

502
01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:59.620
Zeljko Ivezic: It's defined by 2 numbers by the location, by the central position of the Gaussian, and it's defined by Sigma, which is the bit of the Gaussian.

503
01:08:59.689 --> 01:09:07.950
Zeljko Ivezic: And then I have dot, and now I have many different methods, many different functions I can call, and so Pdf. Gives me

504
01:09:08.779 --> 01:09:10.470
Zeljko Ivezic: values of that

505
01:09:10.750 --> 01:09:15.120
Zeljko Ivezic: distribution at an array of values called X

506
01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:21.870
Zeljko Ivezic: and X. I just defined above. I go from 2 0 to 200 with 1,000 steps.

507
01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:32.010
Zeljko Ivezic: and then I can make myself a little plot. and that's my little plot, and that's actually one of the 2 plots you reproduce in test installation. And so

508
01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:44.450
Zeljko Ivezic: this is an example of a distribution. Now you can have any other distribution with these tools from side pi, you can generate a sample. You can dro from it in an easy way. You'll do that in a moment.

509
01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:50.370
Zeljko Ivezic: or you can plot it on log scale. Look at the details of the distribution, etc., etc.

510
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:58.380
Zeljko Ivezic: So, in addition to the distribution itself, here is example: how you call cumulative distribution function.

511
01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:01.870
Zeljko Ivezic: And so that gives you integral of that

512
01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:07.470
Zeljko Ivezic: of this function. You go from minus infinity. So you go from left.

513
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:17.570
Zeljko Ivezic: and you give it X. Let's say 145. This is where my cursor is. It will give you integral under this curve from minus infinity to that point.

514
01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:22.510
Zeljko Ivezic: Of course, if you go to far right to infinity, the results will be exactly one.

515
01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:28.470
Zeljko Ivezic: But then, if you're in this region, you will get some small numbers that give you probability to be that large.

516
01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:34.600
Zeljko Ivezic: And so here I just printed one minus that. So it's one in 1,000 probability.

517
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:46.040
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now why am I using this meal, and Sigma Mu and 100 that Sigma 15. Those of you who studied psychology know that this is distribution of IQ for people.

518
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:55.090
Zeljko Ivezic: By definition, it's normalized. You do your IQ test. They do it on a large number of people, and then they renormalized

519
01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:03.890
Zeljko Ivezic: the renormalize this course, so that the center is 100, and the standard deviation is about 15.

520
01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:18.090
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now, if you know how to handle Gaussian distribution, you can find out how many of your friends are geniuses you deals, or whatever you want to know. So that's what my few examples are shown.

521
01:11:19.670 --> 01:11:20.800
Zeljko Ivezic: Now

522
01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:24.970
Zeljko Ivezic: there are some words we are not supposed to use anymore. So

523
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:41.700
Zeljko Ivezic: things like Moran, you know, that was actually psychological term, which is now out of fashion. This is not politically correct anymore, but they do come from the cumulative, from the points in the cumulative distribution for Gaussian function.

524
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:52.970
Zeljko Ivezic: So here we say. Oh. that girl is one in a 1 million people Genius. I met 1 million girls, and she's the smartest.

525
01:11:53.100 --> 01:12:00.660
Zeljko Ivezic: How would you calculate IQ. Of that person? Well, it's easy, because you know the probability is one in a 1 million.

526
01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:07.080
Zeljko Ivezic: And then you you just solve this equation. How many sigmas you have to go away from the main

527
01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:14.550
Zeljko Ivezic: to get to that probability. So if you have IQ of 100, 7,170,

528
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:24.000
Zeljko Ivezic: that makes you one in a 1 million. So we would think that someone with an IQ of 170 would show up once in Zagreb.

529
01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:27.890
Zeljko Ivezic: Obviously they won't. Come to this lecture, so it's none of us.

530
01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:44.300
Zeljko Ivezic: Now another thing in science. When we say well, especially in biology, people will say at 95% confidence level. I can tell you that there is a fact when I give this medicine to my right or something.

531
01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:49.550
Zeljko Ivezic: So this 95% confidence level that's actually 2 sigma

532
01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:51.200
Zeljko Ivezic: for gaussian distribution.

533
01:12:51.630 --> 01:13:03.060
Zeljko Ivezic: Now you could say what is 3 sigma, what is 5 sigma. and so 3. Sigma is one in 1,000 approximately. and 5 sigma is approximately one in a 1 million.

534
01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.340
Zeljko Ivezic: There is also in in context of physics and astronomy, there is saying that

535
01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:17.290
Zeljko Ivezic: if you have a theorist with a theory to convince the that he is correct or she is correct, takes 2 sigma results.

536
01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:22.780
Zeljko Ivezic: To convince observer or experimentalist that there is an effect. It takes 3 sigma results.

537
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:28.640
Zeljko Ivezic: but to convince theorists that his or her theory is wrong. It takes 5 signals.

538
01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:31.130
Zeljko Ivezic: So these are the probabilities.

539
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:43.670
Zeljko Ivezic: So now we did it 2 ways here. So this is now that other parts how you can handle distributions. So I gave it sample size. Now, 1 million

540
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:50.410
Zeljko Ivezic: and this simple, innocent line will return 1 million data points to me

541
01:13:50.530 --> 01:13:53.710
Zeljko Ivezic: an array of 1 million values. These rbs

542
01:13:53.720 --> 01:14:00.840
Zeljko Ivezic: will generate randomly drawn sample of this size from that Gaussian distribution.

543
01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:04.640
Zeljko Ivezic: So now I can play games. I can simulate my observations

544
01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:09.640
Zeljko Ivezic: if I know that I can assume I measure IQ of everyone in Zagre.

545
01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:19.050
Zeljko Ivezic: And now I can see how well I can actually make some statistical conclusions. And first of all, you actually find out that these numbers

546
01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:22.810
Zeljko Ivezic: are not the same, Even though we asked exactly the same question.

547
01:14:22.890 --> 01:14:28.230
Zeljko Ivezic: one was analytic result. The other one was based on a sample of 1 million people.

548
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:30.290
Zeljko Ivezic: They are not the same.

549
01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:34.710
Zeljko Ivezic: because analytic results when available, they are exact.

550
01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:38.790
Zeljko Ivezic: When you have a sample you can never have exact result

551
01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:49.770
Zeljko Ivezic: except by luck; or if you have an infinitely large sample. and so in in practice, when we do when we do science. When we measure things

552
01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:53.780
Zeljko Ivezic: we can never have perfect result. There will always be.

553
01:14:53.870 --> 01:15:03.410
Zeljko Ivezic: and uncertainty associated with our quantitative result, and we need to understand how large it is, and what it means. So in this baby examples

554
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:07.310
Zeljko Ivezic: you can see immediately how the the results differ.

555
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:12.810
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you can also do sub samples. For example, I define here for fun

556
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:18.820
Zeljko Ivezic: smart ones They are the smart ones, those that are 3 Sigma about. So if it's one in a 1,000,

557
01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:25.550
Zeljko Ivezic: if you have IQ, over 145, you are one in a 1,000 and psychologist volume

558
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:32.920
Zeljko Ivezic: the modern world is extra gifted or particularly highly gifted, highly gifted.

559
01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:36.340
Zeljko Ivezic: That's what they do with kids in the Us. So you are highly gifted.

560
01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.560
Zeljko Ivezic: and so now you can play this various games with your samples.

561
01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:50.610
Zeljko Ivezic: And now this is now this politically incorrect thing. So I removed the words. But IQ between 50 and 71.

562
01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:52.620
Zeljko Ivezic: That's

563
01:15:54.080 --> 01:16:04.150
Zeljko Ivezic: that's more on yeah, and below 51. That's it yet in according to the old nomenclature, this is back bad at that, don't use that. But this is where the numbers come from.

564
01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:14.980
Zeljko Ivezic: They are more than names for that. And now you can find out the probabilities of people who unfortunately have these like use. Of course it's symmetric with the other side. So

565
01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:20.590
Zeljko Ivezic: 3 Sigma deviation goes both ways. And so this

566
01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:24.750
Zeljko Ivezic: analysis of this extreme probabilities that's

567
01:16:24.850 --> 01:16:29.510
Zeljko Ivezic: other main for Gaussian confidence levels. So you have some distribution.

568
01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:43.130
Zeljko Ivezic: and so you can think of it as the result of some analysis, some measurement, we say, Well, I measured temperature in this room to be 30 degrees, and then my uncertainty is 5 degrees.

569
01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:55.280
Zeljko Ivezic: What does it mean? Well, it means that it's 2 segment level. So 10 degrees i'm 95% confident that that temperature is below 40.

570
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.240
Zeljko Ivezic: And so in classical statistics.

571
01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:03.500
Zeljko Ivezic: what it means is that if I measured the same experiment 20 times.

572
01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:09.680
Zeljko Ivezic: only once I would get this out outside of this of this limit.

573
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:15.230
Zeljko Ivezic: Now we will learn in 2 lectures that that's actually not the question you are asking in science

574
01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:20.130
Zeljko Ivezic: the question we are asking in science is given my measurement.

575
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:34.670
Zeljko Ivezic: What is the probability of this data set of of this in code context of this data set? What is the probability that temperature is is in this Inter. I'm not going to measure 20 times the temperature. This this this is hypothetical.

576
01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:47.170
Zeljko Ivezic: I will just measure it once, and I know I want to know probability that the truth is in some given specified intel. Sometimes you can't do many measurements. Let's say we measure the mass of subtle.

577
01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:54.810
Zeljko Ivezic: That's actually the original question that that Laplace asked when he introduced this concept to his own statistics.

578
01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:57.420
Zeljko Ivezic: With it's atom, we cannot measure.

579
01:17:57.450 --> 01:18:07.910
Zeljko Ivezic: It's mass 100 times, because there is only one certain given our measurement. We want to know what is the confidence interrupt for that measurement, so we'll get back to that later.

580
01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:19.010
Zeljko Ivezic: For now let's ignore this little problem of different questions, and just ask if I have a sample like the one they just generated with 1 million points.

581
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:27.920
Zeljko Ivezic: If we have that sample, how do I, from that sample estimate what was Mu and Sigma in the underlying distribution?

582
01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:30.660
Zeljko Ivezic: And of course you know that from kindergarten.

583
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:39.130
Zeljko Ivezic: when we take a sample and calculate mean value, that's what gives you that mu for the Gaussian distribution.

584
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:44.610
Zeljko Ivezic: Now they are some tricky things about it. We'll try to address some of them next time.

585
01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:54.980
Zeljko Ivezic: If you have no Gaussian outliers in your real life measurements, then that will screw up this this formula badly.

586
01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:04.420
Zeljko Ivezic: or if you have different distributions, if you assume this Gaussian, but it's actually distribution, then it's all over the place, and that's actually the last example today.

587
01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.240
Zeljko Ivezic: So what this last part of the lecture is.

588
01:19:08.730 --> 01:19:10.850
Zeljko Ivezic: it's if we have now

589
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:28.510
Zeljko Ivezic: measurements a sample like the one that is generated from Gaussian distribution. How do we estimate the properties of the Gaussian, New and Sigma? And, more importantly, what is the uncertainty on those properties? So basically your introductory physics lab, or any other file Science lab.

590
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:45.890
Zeljko Ivezic: So you can derive this formula easily. That different base, like, for example, maximum likelihood, which we will learn to next time, but for now I can just assume that my underlying distribution is just delta function centered on the values that I have in my sample.

591
01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:51.910
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you can easily plug this into this formula for expectation, value, and variance.

592
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:54.790
Zeljko Ivezic: and you can derive

593
01:19:55.220 --> 01:20:00.800
Zeljko Ivezic: that Mu is estimated by taking the mean value of your data points.

594
01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:06.720
Zeljko Ivezic: and the sample variance is estimated as the mean value of

595
01:20:06.810 --> 01:20:09.240
Zeljko Ivezic: of deviations from the mean square.

596
01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:12.480
Zeljko Ivezic: You know that formula. I'm sure from your labs.

597
01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:17.060
Zeljko Ivezic: Now there is this little bit of detail. Why is it n minus one and N.

598
01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:34.690
Zeljko Ivezic: When n is large, you don't care when any small. There was a little bit of difference. We will learn in in third lecture or fourth lecture. Why is it so? It's called basal correction in classical statistics. It's a lot of handwriting to derive it by using statistics that comes like this. So we'll we'll get back to that.

599
01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:49.010
Zeljko Ivezic: And then another thing is okay, I mentioned what biased in here. So it is a good points to introduce what is bias. So on the left hand side we have one dimensional example.

600
01:20:49.240 --> 01:21:01.620
Zeljko Ivezic: there is reference value. This is underlying truth, like temperature in this room. and then i'm measuring this with some apparatus, and I get distribution of measurements that are given by this Gaussian on the right.

601
01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:12.530
Zeljko Ivezic: So now there is. You can see immediately that it's offset, and that offset from the true value. It's called bias, so imagine I have to remove the thermometer in here.

602
01:21:12.850 --> 01:21:21.700
Zeljko Ivezic: and for some reason it wasn't calibrated properly. It always gives 5 degrees to high. Whatever is the temperature. Why, you remember this

603
01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:31.150
Zeljko Ivezic: mercury thermometers a metal scale in front. Let's say someone glued it incorrectly on the front, and it's offset by 5 degrees. There's the bias.

604
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:39.630
Zeljko Ivezic: and the precision is deviations about the biased value. So this is precision.

605
01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:42.320
Zeljko Ivezic: This is bias.

606
01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:49.550
Zeljko Ivezic: and then I square them. I get what statisticians call means per error, and in science we call it accuracy.

607
01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.710
Zeljko Ivezic: So to have high accuracy

608
01:21:53.110 --> 01:22:00.040
Zeljko Ivezic: you need to have small bias and high precision. And so Here is example that grows from

609
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:01.420
Zeljko Ivezic: from

610
01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:13.570
Zeljko Ivezic: shooting. Maybe it's not the best example given what happened yesterday in Belgrade, but it's easy to understand it. So if you have very accurate sharp shooter that you get all your

611
01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:18.970
Zeljko Ivezic: bullets, all your bullet holes in the center of your target with small dispersion.

612
01:22:20.770 --> 01:22:24.410
Zeljko Ivezic: This guy here doesn't have bias, but it's bad shooter.

613
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:30.760
Zeljko Ivezic: and so they're scattered all around, but not biased. and this example here is

614
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:34.560
Zeljko Ivezic: very precise shooter. But there is a bias.

615
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:47.830
Zeljko Ivezic: and so it's offset from the center. And of course, these 2, this one is both biased and and low precision. So again, that 3 terms to remember bias, precision, accuracy.

616
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:56.620
Zeljko Ivezic: accuracy, something in absolute sense, very good. and contribution to accuracy or decrease of accuracy, can be either

617
01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:02.180
Zeljko Ivezic: low precision, which means scattered. Or it can be high bias which means offset.

618
01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.220
Zeljko Ivezic: So these are the concepts we have.

619
01:23:05.450 --> 01:23:08.860
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now, going back to this estimators.

620
01:23:08.930 --> 01:23:14.930
Zeljko Ivezic: Every baby knows how to do this. So that's what you get from your measurements. But the question is now.

621
01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:19.630
Zeljko Ivezic: how far will be that Estimator X.

622
01:23:20.130 --> 01:23:23.970
Zeljko Ivezic: And as from the true values statistically.

623
01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:28.610
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's where the concept of the standard error of the mean

624
01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.950
Zeljko Ivezic: and error of the standard deviation comes in. This tells you

625
01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:44.400
Zeljko Ivezic: how far, on average, you will be from the truth. So, whatever you do, you will have uncertainties in your measurement, and your measurements will not have

626
01:23:44.490 --> 01:23:45.840
Zeljko Ivezic: infinite size.

627
01:23:46.090 --> 01:23:57.610
Zeljko Ivezic: And so, when you estimate in the simplest possible case for Gaussian, those 2 parameters. you should expect that they will be on average, scattered around the truth. And these 2 formula. Tell you.

628
01:23:57.730 --> 01:24:08.420
Zeljko Ivezic: what is that? And that can be derived in many different ways. and we will show how to derive it easily when we get to Bayesian statistics.

629
01:24:08.670 --> 01:24:20.380
Zeljko Ivezic: But in this context of basic statistics these 4 expressions are the most important formula in introductory undergrad lab in physics or chemistry or biology.

630
01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:26.690
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is how you estimate. given some one-dimensional set of measurements and measurements.

631
01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:32.990
Zeljko Ivezic: This is how you estimate the best properties of Gaussian. Its position, and it's wet

632
01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:38.060
Zeljko Ivezic: so you that's basically fitting a Gaussian indirectly to your data.

633
01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:44.610
Zeljko Ivezic: But you don't have to do any fitting program. You just calculate what is X Bar and S.

634
01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:50.880
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now there is one more topic to conclude it.

635
01:24:52.210 --> 01:24:59.040
Zeljko Ivezic: So These are the standard low, so-called low order statistics, or moments of the physical distribution

636
01:24:59.270 --> 01:25:03.940
Zeljko Ivezic: you can. You can calculate them for any sample.

637
01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:16.250
Zeljko Ivezic: Sometimes you will get to be of things like this or a Lorentzian distribution. You'll get back to it one warning. When you calculate this low order, statistics like mean value and standard deviation.

638
01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:18.060
Zeljko Ivezic: you can often

639
01:25:18.370 --> 01:25:24.980
Zeljko Ivezic: make yourself believe that you know what's going on. But actually you can have many different distributions. These are called.

640
01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:36.700
Zeljko Ivezic: and scones for that. All these 4 distributions have the same mean value of x mean value of y dispersion in x dispersion, and y the same correlation efficient.

641
01:25:37.290 --> 01:25:49.910
Zeljko Ivezic: identical, and yet they are very different sub samples. And so here is stable with summary of that. So? The last thing is robust statistics. I promise to you that

642
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:56.570
Zeljko Ivezic: your mean value will be scattered around this value with this standard variation.

643
01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.700
Zeljko Ivezic: But I did not emphasize that this is

644
01:26:00.730 --> 01:26:03.100
Zeljko Ivezic: coming from the central limit, Crm.

645
01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:09.310
Zeljko Ivezic: which nobody cares because it has word theorem in it. But it tells you that if you have

646
01:26:09.570 --> 01:26:10.960
Zeljko Ivezic: arbitrary

647
01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:18.770
Zeljko Ivezic: distribution which has finite standard deviation, then it guarantees that if you have an measurement.

648
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:23.710
Zeljko Ivezic: the mean value will be centered on location through location with the schedule.

649
01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:25.960
Zeljko Ivezic: And of course

650
01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:30.990
Zeljko Ivezic: most people ignore that if you have finite standard deviation.

651
01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:36.710
Zeljko Ivezic: and sometimes they work with real data, and they just show that it doesn't work

652
01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:39.350
Zeljko Ivezic: some central limit to you.

653
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:46.000
Zeljko Ivezic: But what happens is the Trm. Didn't like to you, because to your and clearly said, if you have finite standard deviation.

654
01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.530
Zeljko Ivezic: and they are distribution where they they run away like what she

655
01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:53.180
Zeljko Ivezic: Here, If you look at this formula on the right.

656
01:26:53.730 --> 01:27:03.500
Zeljko Ivezic: it's because she distribution. It looks very similar to Gaussian. It's centrally peaked, but then it has tails that fall off much slower than Gaussian. The Gaussian.

657
01:27:03.610 --> 01:27:13.440
Zeljko Ivezic: It drops down exponentially here. If you assume now that X is very large. you can immediately see that this formula says one over X pair.

658
01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:23.000
Zeljko Ivezic: But if you calculate standard deviation for variance. There is this X squared in here and now you plug one over X for the largest.

659
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:24.300
Zeljko Ivezic: so they cancel.

660
01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:28.060
Zeljko Ivezic: And now you have constant, which you integrate to infinity.

661
01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:35.770
Zeljko Ivezic: And what is the result of integrating a constant to infinity? If that constant is not 0, it's infinity.

662
01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:40.250
Zeljko Ivezic: So the basic premise of central limit theorem

663
01:27:40.350 --> 01:27:46.300
Zeljko Ivezic: that you have finite standard deviation is wrong. and this promise that the mean value

664
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:53.460
Zeljko Ivezic: there you go. The mean value will be scheduled around the truth with this. scatter it doesn't work

665
01:27:54.480 --> 01:28:04.330
Zeljko Ivezic: if you have distributions with fat tails like distribution. So the last piece of this lecture is the Lorentz distribution.

666
01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:12.670
Zeljko Ivezic: and we generated Here we import Kashi. It's sci-fi. It's called K. She that's how it looks like

667
01:28:13.150 --> 01:28:18.790
Zeljko Ivezic: similar to Gaussian. But these sales do not fall off as fast in a Gaussian.

668
01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:25.280
Zeljko Ivezic: And then we ask, what do we do with real data if we have

669
01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:28.410
Zeljko Ivezic: data coming from some distribution with fat tails?

670
01:28:28.810 --> 01:28:32.610
Zeljko Ivezic: And so that's the question of robust statistic.

671
01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:36.410
Zeljko Ivezic: So with me. Imagine

672
01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:47.850
Zeljko Ivezic: you want to find out which salary and say, Seattle. you take 1 million people. You add up their salaries you divide by 1 million. You get mean salary.

673
01:28:48.150 --> 01:28:57.840
Zeljko Ivezic: and you look at the distribution of sellers. But then you can also have Bill Gates in your business who live in Seattle. Each of them has about 100 billiondollars.

674
01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:00.720
Zeljko Ivezic: so one of them contributes under it

675
01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:06.330
Zeljko Ivezic: 1 billiondollars to the sum you divide by that 1 million number of people.

676
01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.380
Zeljko Ivezic: and you get 100,000.

677
01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:17.620
Zeljko Ivezic: So your entire distribution is biased by 100,000 because of one of them, and second, one of them biases for it.

678
01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:26.110
Zeljko Ivezic: So they represent huge outliers that that make that assumption of the wrong.

679
01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:35.940
Zeljko Ivezic: So in practice, when you have measurements that the lousy and you suspect they do not follow Gaussian distribution, then it's much better to take Median.

680
01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.170
Zeljko Ivezic: Then me

681
01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:46.810
Zeljko Ivezic: so in Croatia I mean it's prostate, not weirdness. And Median is the sample in half.

682
01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:49.570
Zeljko Ivezic: And now, when you have this middle point.

683
01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:54.330
Zeljko Ivezic: those 2 points that the Jeff business and Bill Gates, they can have infinite salary.

684
01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:57.640
Zeljko Ivezic: and they will have no impact on the median value

685
01:29:57.670 --> 01:30:15.390
Zeljko Ivezic: because they're simply just pushing the but I already split the distribution in half. So for distributions that have or unknown distributions. When you do real work, measurements or something, it is much better first to say what is the median of this example.

686
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:20.900
Zeljko Ivezic: and If that medium is very different than me, then you should think hard about what's going on.

687
01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:22.840
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's the first rule of them.

688
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:29.710
Zeljko Ivezic: also with the with the standard deviation. It's also very, very sensitive

689
01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:37.090
Zeljko Ivezic: to outliers, and if you try to get standard deviation with an outlier, it will go to infinity. But theoretically

690
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:43.200
Zeljko Ivezic: so they are 2. You can define points in the cumulative distribution. So Median is 50% point.

691
01:30:43.330 --> 01:30:57.300
Zeljko Ivezic: You can define 25 and 75% points in human on the distribution or order your measured sample ranked order, and then take first for time plus portile, and whatever you get with your inter portal range.

692
01:30:57.300 --> 01:31:07.160
Zeljko Ivezic: there is some magic constant that brings it on the same scale as Gaussian, and that's much more robust. Then this basic formula that we learn in kindergarten

693
01:31:07.190 --> 01:31:14.290
Zeljko Ivezic: these 2 they are they now. So this is what we learn in standard, at least here in standard physics lab.

694
01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:21.740
Zeljko Ivezic: But this doesn't work well in real life. and what you want to do is media and interportal range.

695
01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:25.350
Zeljko Ivezic: and how to do that is described here

696
01:31:25.530 --> 01:31:32.080
Zeljko Ivezic: and visually. This little experiment is summarized in this figure. So what does it show?

697
01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:34.550
Zeljko Ivezic: We drove

698
01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:38.700
Zeljko Ivezic: I sample from the sheet distribution. The bottom 10

699
01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:52.910
Zeljko Ivezic: shows 100 points. X X. It doesn't mean much. It's order of the and the Y. We draw it from a sheet distribution center, the 0

700
01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:58.170
Zeljko Ivezic: and and and let me remind myself what was the standard deviation?

701
01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:05.800
Zeljko Ivezic: So standard deviation is about 2, and so we have 100 points.

702
01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:07.080
Zeljko Ivezic: So

703
01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:11.090
Zeljko Ivezic: one in 1,000 is 3 Sigma deviation.

704
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:19.970
Zeljko Ivezic: So if it was. you will never be part from the central line, if the 6 of them.

705
01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:27.580
Zeljko Ivezic: But you can clearly see that that a number of points in that sample, that of 10 or more.

706
01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:30.760
Zeljko Ivezic: This because it's

707
01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:39.620
Zeljko Ivezic: there's one probability to be far away from from the central location.

708
01:32:40.230 --> 01:32:41.610
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now

709
01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:48.430
Zeljko Ivezic: you assume this is middle example, and now we measure the mean value in the top 10.

710
01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:58.980
Zeljko Ivezic: So you just say, this is a function of number of points, 3.4, point 4, and so on up to 100 points, and you plot me.

711
01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:08.250
Zeljko Ivezic: The blue line is the so you can see how it just jumps around as soon as we have one of those

712
01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:15.300
Zeljko Ivezic: points that the far out mean goes far away and comes back down. And then again it goes away.

713
01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:24.970
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay, so that's because of this point that if you're so, it's out of contribution. They will be outliers in distribution. They are not downloaded by their regular bodies.

714
01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:27.110
Zeljko Ivezic: but there is no

715
01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:44.670
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's something to remember. And now we practice what we do.

716
01:34:02.850 --> 01:34:09.130
Zeljko Ivezic: What's much better to do is we use robot statistics like media, and

717
01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:18.910
Zeljko Ivezic: because in this case you know what you can estimate. Well, it's so from me to Media.

718
01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:28.610
Zeljko Ivezic: You can show that the scheduler number so.

719
01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:34.800
Zeljko Ivezic: But in

720
01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:35.890
Zeljko Ivezic: this you

721
01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:36.760
okay

722
01:34:43.570 --> 01:34:52.350
Zeljko Ivezic: your media.

723
01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:55.980
Zeljko Ivezic: And you look at the talk.

724
01:34:56.090 --> 01:35:00.760
Zeljko Ivezic: the

725
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:03.740
Zeljko Ivezic: and you can see how quickly it

726
01:35:06.130 --> 01:35:23.420
Zeljko Ivezic: and it's not working much around all of these like points in the bottom of the far out. They don't do much that sample many 2 millions just like.

727
01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:27.610
Zeljko Ivezic: But there is a point. This is

728
01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:34.840
Zeljko Ivezic: so. This is the last thing today. I know we covered a lot. If you feel like

729
01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:42.980
Zeljko Ivezic: It's all over the place, and you feel like the around you. Don't worry. It's regular feeling. I put way too much in that one lecture.

730
01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:45.910
Zeljko Ivezic: But please do go over it when you go home.

731
01:35:46.090 --> 01:35:55.010
Zeljko Ivezic: and then try to look at the lecture number 2 before the next time, and then next time it will become more interesting.

732
01:35:55.750 --> 01:36:02.630
Zeljko Ivezic: Then today it will be more useful methods, and then we really

733
01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:11.740
Zeljko Ivezic: so Thank you again and thank you all on Zoom for coming in.

734
01:36:14.190 --> 01:36:16.870
Zeljko Ivezic: That's still 11 young people.

735
01:36:20.890 --> 01:36:22.560
Zeljko Ivezic: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

736
01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:28.260
Zeljko Ivezic: I will stop recording now. Thank you all for coming. See you on Monday.
