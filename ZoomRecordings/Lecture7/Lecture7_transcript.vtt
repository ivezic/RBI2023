1
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.860
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay.

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:17.990
Zeljko Ivezic: So all the lectures are at the same website that we use last time, and the the remaining 6 lectures will be at the same place.

3
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:26.260
Zeljko Ivezic: Here is the link at the bottom of the first paragraph, where you can get new lectures for this week and for the remainder of the course.

4
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.030
Zeljko Ivezic: So I'll start today by

5
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:41.719
Zeljko Ivezic: a quick summary of what we will cover in these 6 lectures. So if you find it interesting, you can continue, if you already know that or you're not interested.

6
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.529
Zeljko Ivezic: you can skip.

7
00:00:43.650 --> 00:01:01.280
Zeljko Ivezic: So machine learning has many different definitions, and so almost everyone defines it in different way. There are broad definitions. They are narrow definitions. Sometimes people include AI that requires its own artificial intelligence, its own definitions.

8
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.340
Zeljko Ivezic: So I thought it would be more practical, just full list

9
00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:13.130
Zeljko Ivezic: topics that we will cover in these 6 lectures, and they cover pretty much everything that we do in machine learning.

10
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.940
Zeljko Ivezic: So one very basic curriculum for introduction to machine learning would include these 6 topics here.

11
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.839
Zeljko Ivezic: So density estimation, we'll talk more about it today. It's basically

12
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:39.910
Zeljko Ivezic: taking a point process of a multi-dimensional space with lots of points, and you want to derive continuum density distribution of those points that is not consistent with the data that you have at hand

13
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.480
Zeljko Ivezic: regression. We did little bit of it in the first part of the class. We are not going to go much deeper with that

14
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:57.820
Zeljko Ivezic: time series. Analysis is important in engineering and in, for example, astronomy, sometimes even in physics. In general.

15
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.009
Zeljko Ivezic: we are not going to talk much about it. You'll focus on the last 3 topics. So one is dimensionality reduction.

16
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.070
Zeljko Ivezic: So often when we want to do some machine learning, we want to

17
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.709
Zeljko Ivezic: classify something, we want to cluster the data you, you can have thousands of dimensions, and then it becomes.

18
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.350
Zeljko Ivezic: it becomes complicated to to quantify structure. But there are methods where we can show that the information

19
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:40.379
Zeljko Ivezic: content of such data set can be summarized in a much smaller number of parameters. The most famous method is principal components analysis, and those CPU applications. So that's one big topic in machine learning.

20
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:54.779
Zeljko Ivezic: Then, as the derivative of density estimation, we can also do clustering, basically, you have set of points. And you ask yourself, are these points in that multi-dimensional space of measurements

21
00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:07.699
Zeljko Ivezic: randomly distributed? Or do these points show structure like multiple clouds points? And you want to teach your computer to find these clouds and quantify them.

22
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:32.649
Zeljko Ivezic: and then, once you have the clustering, then often you can also use it for classification. If it turns out that your data are not randomly distributed, but in some parameter space the form clusters. Often you identify each cluster with something physical. For example, in astronomy we can observe stars, galaxies, quasars, you measure something, and you get 4 clusters.

23
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.970
Zeljko Ivezic: And now you have a new measurement.

24
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:45.479
Zeljko Ivezic: and if you know what each cluster means, then new measurements will fall into one of these clusters, and then you know immediately that you observe a star or a galaxy, or something.

25
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:53.799
Zeljko Ivezic: The other example would be outliers. You have a new measurement. And that measurement is not consistent with any of those clusters.

26
00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:06.890
Zeljko Ivezic: And typically, it's either some problem with your measurement apparatus, or often it is super interesting source, especially in astrophysics, and something is very, very different. You can learn a lot about

27
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.680
Zeljko Ivezic: underlying physics.

28
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:17.280
Zeljko Ivezic: of course, clusters themselves also do teach you something that outliers are also interesting. I ask once my wife.

29
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:32.689
Zeljko Ivezic: she's American, I said. Did you learn more about Croatia coming to Croatia, meeting many people, and you know, than superficially, or did you learn more from about Croatia from me? Because you have your husband, and you know me much better than any other person.

30
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:42.200
Zeljko Ivezic: But she said, Well, I think both are useful. You see, when I go to Croatia I learn a lot from other people, but not farity. I could learn more from you.

31
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:50.299
Zeljko Ivezic: But who may be video? And then my impression of Croatia will be biased by how you'll be paid, said good point, good point.

32
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.599
Zeljko Ivezic: So you won't vote.

33
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.870
Zeljko Ivezic: And machine learning is becoming more and more important for 2 reasons.

34
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:16.980
Zeljko Ivezic: One is, and they are related to each other. One reason is that we can actually do it with computers. And computing technology is now developed sufficiently that you can apply many methods in practice that you couldn't if you had to do it on a piece of paper.

35
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.369
Zeljko Ivezic: So you can fit Gaussians. You can fit straight line. You can do this method

36
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:35.219
Zeljko Ivezic: on a piece of paper. But if you have a billion data points in 10,000 dimensional space, then you can't do it anymore. With piece of paper and a pencil you have to do. You have to use computers.

37
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:49.550
Zeljko Ivezic: And for the same reason, because of the rapid development of technology in general and computers in particular. We now also have datasets that we cannot handle anymore with with paper. And and so they are too large.

38
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.419
Zeljko Ivezic: And so one example that they put here on on this

39
00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:04.789
Zeljko Ivezic: comes from project that I do for living. So this is fun being here. But I also have to do my day job. And so it's building a new telescope that you'll have

40
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:11.760
Zeljko Ivezic: a large camera of its 3 gigapixels. And so every night you'll get about 1,000 images with that camera.

41
00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.700
Zeljko Ivezic: So after 10 years we'll collect the database of images that will be 100 petabytes.

42
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.909
Zeljko Ivezic: And we are now developing software that will go through those images.

43
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:32.780
Zeljko Ivezic: and it will automatically recognize sources, objects in those images like stars and galaxies, etcetera. And we estimate that we'll have about 40 billion

44
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.929
Zeljko Ivezic: such objects in our database, once we find them all. And so each of them will be

45
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.789
Zeljko Ivezic: observed about 1,000 times during that 10 year period.

46
00:06:43.990 --> 00:07:00.849
Zeljko Ivezic: and so in each observation we'll measure many parameters. But just for the sake of argument, let's say we measure 10 parameters in one image for one object like, what is the position of that object? What is its flux? What are structural parameters? If it's resolved galaxy, etc.

47
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:11.930
Zeljko Ivezic: So you have 10,000 numbers, you measure them 1,000 times, and each time you measure 10 numbers. So it's 10,000 numbers. It's 10,000 dimensional space.

48
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.980
Zeljko Ivezic: And in that space you have 40 billion points.

49
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.570
Zeljko Ivezic: And now you want to do something with that data set.

50
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:28.579
Zeljko Ivezic: And so this bottom left 3 dimensional diagram is an attempt to visualize what we do with machine learning in this context.

51
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:39.569
Zeljko Ivezic: So there are only 3 coordinates here. V. One, v. 2, and v. 3. But in principle you could go up to 10,000 with this data set. Of course, it's hard to visualize 10,000 dimensional space.

52
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.099
Zeljko Ivezic: but for the sake of argument of what we do 3 dimensional Xenon.

53
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:54.170
Zeljko Ivezic: You see these different morphological structures in this diagram. So imagine that these are many, many, many points. And then we use those points, too.

54
00:07:54.200 --> 00:08:06.010
Zeljko Ivezic: to measure the shape, the outline of their distribution of those clouds. Sometimes they look like clouds on this kind, sometimes they have more regular morphology like you can see this green torus.

55
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.330
Zeljko Ivezic: you can see this red thing that looks like Red bean.

56
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:18.710
Zeljko Ivezic: Something looks like a tooth on the right, or used bubble gum, or whatever different morphologies we want to teach computer to recognize them.

57
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:25.600
Zeljko Ivezic: And so that's called clustering or characterization of known populations.

58
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:39.329
Zeljko Ivezic: And then, once you have these clusters, then you want to characterize what they are. And this is typically done by taking a subset of sources

59
00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:57.040
Zeljko Ivezic: and then obtaining additional observations that will tell you more about them. And then you conclude, for example, that this green torus is composed, say, of asterisk, and then every new observation that you get in that green torus, you know it's an asterisk.

60
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:06.669
Zeljko Ivezic: and then sometimes you will find objects like these few dots marked with question. Mark that. Do not fit any of those clusters.

61
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.139
Zeljko Ivezic: and those are outliers that I mentioned earlier.

62
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:18.030
Zeljko Ivezic: So the basic steps that we want to do with any large data set like this is first clustering

63
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:33.559
Zeljko Ivezic: and pre-rex equals 4. Clustering is often basic estimation that you've talked about today. And then you do classification. And then you search for outliers. So that's like high level summary of what we want to do.

64
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:46.610
Zeljko Ivezic: So let me now provide just little bit more illustration. What we think by that. So density, estimation will be the topic of today's lecture in this diagram below there are 3 panels.

65
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.660
Zeljko Ivezic: So on the first panel on the left. These are measurements of something.

66
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.020
Zeljko Ivezic: So we have 2 coordinates. This is 2 dimensional space. We measure X and Y.

67
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:06.089
Zeljko Ivezic: There are maybe few 1,000 points in this diagram, and you can even see by eye that they come in 2 clusters in 2 clumps.

68
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.260
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now we would like to develop a method that

69
00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.389
Zeljko Ivezic: will give us continuous density distribution

70
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:23.899
Zeljko Ivezic: that any point in this diagram, any location in this diagram, will be associated with a continuous density function.

71
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:32.149
Zeljko Ivezic: And so here is one example that was based on Gaussian fits. In the middle panel we have the best fitting

72
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.830
Zeljko Ivezic: series of two-dimensional Gaussians.

73
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:56.969
Zeljko Ivezic: so you can see, the one in the bottom left is stronger than one in the upper right. Also it's not aligned with coordinate axis, so there is some covariance in the description of the Gaussian, and now we can use this model for anything we want, we could use it for classification. We could label those 2 clusters.

74
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.180
Zeljko Ivezic: We can also use it to generate

75
00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:05.319
Zeljko Ivezic: larger samples, so we can clone that distribution. That's the right hand.

76
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.019
Zeljko Ivezic: So once we can

77
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:17.049
Zeljko Ivezic: the continuous description of density, then we can then draw randomly from the distribution and increase our sample size from 1,000 if we want to a million.

78
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:29.680
Zeljko Ivezic: And there are many methods where you need large sample to apply some algorithms. And so in such cases you would increase the size of your sample by doing this fit and then planning.

79
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:36.939
Zeljko Ivezic: So we'll cover later today. Then little bit of introduction Instagram, which is one dimensional density estimation.

80
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:47.809
Zeljko Ivezic: Then we'll talk about few main methods like kernel density estimation. We'll introduce Gaussian mixture. Model again. We did it, I think, in the first part of the course.

81
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:56.149
Zeljko Ivezic: and then we'll again revisit by a Z. And blocks in one dimensional distribution. So that's one topic, density, estimation.

82
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.229
Zeljko Ivezic: The regression is one of the most

83
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.570
Zeljko Ivezic: covered machine learning topics. We are not going to go back to it.

84
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:17.840
Zeljko Ivezic: We did little bit of least squares. If you recall last last part in the first part of the course, we did little bit of paezzy and nonlinear regression, and so, if you go back to those lectures, you can find code

85
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:32.689
Zeljko Ivezic: where you can apply it now to any regression problem that you have, that is nonlinear. If you recall, we introduced Markov Chain, Monte Carlo methods. And so in those lectures we can go back and and remind yourself

86
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:36.679
Zeljko Ivezic: we do that here. This plot shows some data.

87
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:43.519
Zeljko Ivezic: This is a supernova data from cosmology, but doesn't matter what it is. So there are a bunch of data points.

88
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:50.559
Zeljko Ivezic: And then there is some underlying function that we fit. It's parametric fit. There are some parameters.

89
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:56.799
Zeljko Ivezic: and so the right panel then shows for 2 of a number of model parameters. I believe, 6,

90
00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.380
Zeljko Ivezic: 2 that are most interesting. Physically, these contours

91
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:04.439
Zeljko Ivezic: show their posterior probability distribution.

92
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.920
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's example of a regression

93
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.499
Zeljko Ivezic: time series. Analysis is also important. It's a huge topic.

94
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:22.740
Zeljko Ivezic: There are literally thousands of books written about time series. And that's because it's very important in engineering.

95
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:34.359
Zeljko Ivezic: And, for example, in astronomy. Most of these books are useless, because nearly useless, not completely useless, because in astronomy we don't have regular sampling

96
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:54.100
Zeljko Ivezic: in astronomy, or depend on day and night, even during night you can have bad weather, etc. So we have irregular sampling in astronomy, and on top of that, in astronomy error bars are important because they vary a lot with your source, the fainter the source, the larger the error bars.

97
00:13:54.100 --> 00:14:09.399
Zeljko Ivezic: If you have some engineering measurement in some factory or in some machine, then error bars are sometimes negligible, and often they are so-called homo scheduling errors. They are all the same, but in astronomy they vary a lot.

98
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:19.240
Zeljko Ivezic: So in this example. They have bunch of data points, and they look like noise, random noise. But indeed they are just sinusoidal variation

99
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:32.620
Zeljko Ivezic: with a period of oscillation that is much shorter than the typical spacing between data points. So you can't see any sinusoidal variation in this data set because it happens too rapidly.

100
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:44.629
Zeljko Ivezic: But there are methods that you can use mathematical methods that will uncover what is the best period of the sinusoid. And so the bottom panel shows so-called periodogram.

101
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:53.040
Zeljko Ivezic: where essentially you. you try each period in some reasonable range of periods. And then basically, you ask.

102
00:14:53.330 --> 00:15:00.369
Zeljko Ivezic: what is the Chi-square for that fit compared to a fit where I just assumed straight line.

103
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:12.049
Zeljko Ivezic: and you get if you get significant reduction of that Chi square. That means sinusoid is much better fit. And then this y-axis, both power goes to one.

104
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:19.630
Zeljko Ivezic: and if it's low number, that means that sinusoids, it's not much better fit than just straight line.

105
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:29.469
Zeljko Ivezic: And so in this particular case you can see that there is that one peak in the middle of the panel that is higher than any other

106
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:38.140
Zeljko Ivezic: points in the diagram, and that is your best fit period. And then you generate sinusoidal fit and show that it fits data. Well.

107
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:46.760
Zeljko Ivezic: so that's for deterministic power series. There is a whole range of interesting problems where variability is stochastic.

108
00:15:47.000 --> 00:16:03.709
Zeljko Ivezic: where you cannot describe it with an analytic function, you cannot predict precisely what should be the answer. But you can describe statistical properties of such variability, and the methods go from auto correlation functions to

109
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:11.990
Zeljko Ivezic: to structure functions and other ways of describing stochastic variability. It's super important in astronomy, but because

110
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:19.560
Zeljko Ivezic: you don't come only from astronomy background. But general physics. Then we will not cover these in great detail.

111
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:25.579
Zeljko Ivezic: What we will cover in detail is dimensionality reduction. That will be this Thursday.

112
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.270
Zeljko Ivezic: where we will learn about

113
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:41.880
Zeljko Ivezic: few very important methods for reducing dimensionality. And so what this plot shows is so called principle components. I did not show plots with spectra of

114
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:47.399
Zeljko Ivezic: here of spectra of galaxies, so they look very similar to the top left panel.

115
00:16:47.610 --> 00:17:02.270
Zeljko Ivezic: If you just look at that panel. Most galaxies have spectra that look like this. So y-axis is flux. How many photons you get from a galaxy, and the X-axis is way linked. This is an optical way in French, so there are many

116
00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:22.640
Zeljko Ivezic: billions of stars in a galaxy. Each one is radiating differently, approximately, as like body function, not exactly the same, but approximately. And then there is a range of temperature, and so then, once you add them all up, then you get spectrum that looks like this, plus some lines that come from podcast and absorption from cold gas, etc.

117
00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:33.789
Zeljko Ivezic: And so they are. This particular spectra from so called one digital Sky Survey, that 2,000 data points that 2,048 X values, and for each you get flux.

118
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:46.449
Zeljko Ivezic: But physics of galaxies is such that there are no 2,048 independent parameters. It is sufficient to know 4, 5 numbers to describe fully that spectrum in noise.

119
00:17:46.510 --> 00:18:05.349
Zeljko Ivezic: And then you ask yourself, how would I then describe the spec? I don't have exact analytic description for each spectrum, but I can use data sets and run so-called principle component analysis that will try to minimize the remaining variance in the sample with each successive step.

120
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:13.259
Zeljko Ivezic: So this first panel top left is simply the mean spectrum of all the galaxies in that sample.

121
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:27.089
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's typical spectrum. And then it's a linear combination of smaller and smaller corrections to that main mean spectrum, and these are then the spectra in the vertical column.

122
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:56.330
Zeljko Ivezic: And so you add them, then, with some coefficients, and those coefficients are those reduced parameters. So instead of having 1,000 2,048 free parameters or pixels, you end up with 5 or 6 principal components, and all what you need to do for that bala galaxy are the values of those 5 or 6 coefficients that multiply this principle components. That's the idea. And then there are certain complications that we will cover when we get to that lecture.

123
00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:01.600
Zeljko Ivezic: We'll also learn about supervised and

124
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:13.779
Zeljko Ivezic: unsupervised classification. So unsupervised classification is also called clustering. So you have data distribution. like the one in the top

125
00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.110
Zeljko Ivezic: in the bottom left panel.

126
00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:20.410
Zeljko Ivezic: And so you ask yourself, do I see any structure?

127
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:26.680
Zeljko Ivezic: And so in this image. what you see is simply 2 dimensional histogram.

128
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:41.210
Zeljko Ivezic: So you take I forget how many, maybe 100,000 points were used in the diagram. You pixelate your 2 dimensional diagram, and you simply count how many measurements fell in each pixel.

129
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:50.080
Zeljko Ivezic: And that's what this panel shows. So there is. You still don't have any knowledge of the details of the distribution. You just know that

130
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.009
Zeljko Ivezic: you have distribution of something.

131
00:19:53.070 --> 00:20:05.530
Zeljko Ivezic: Then you ask yourself. can I take this density distribution and describe it analytically. And so what was done here was to say, let me assume that the basic components

132
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.260
Zeljko Ivezic: in that diagram are simply Gaussians.

133
00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:13.099
Zeljko Ivezic: and you ask yourself how many Gaussians do. I need

134
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.400
Zeljko Ivezic: to describe this distribution?

135
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:24.530
Zeljko Ivezic: And we'll we'll work this example in in more detail later. But for now you learn that you need 4 Gaussians at least.

136
00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:39.730
Zeljko Ivezic: and the middle panel is what you may recall from the first part of the class when we talked about Bayesian statistics, about Bayesian model selection, and we introduced so-called Vic. B. By Asian information criterion.

137
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:48.200
Zeljko Ivezic: which is in most cases just Chi-square, penalized by the number of free parameters in your model.

138
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:57.690
Zeljko Ivezic: And so this goes down up to 4, because the more Gaussians to add the better description you get of your left panel.

139
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:04.050
Zeljko Ivezic: but once you hit 4 you have fairly decent description, and then you start

140
00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:33.139
Zeljko Ivezic: getting penalized for more free parameters. Each new Gaussian brings you. So in 2D. You have 4 new parameters no more. You have center. That's 2. You have 3 sigma, 5, normalization. 6. You have 6 parameters with each new component, and then you start getting penalized, then your conclusion is 4 is the simplest method, simplest model that is still consistent with my data.

141
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:37.340
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's example of such clustering. We learn more methods like that.

142
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:46.979
Zeljko Ivezic: Then another. Another big application of machine learning is supervised classification.

143
00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:53.359
Zeljko Ivezic: which is very similar to unsupervised, except that we also have labels.

144
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.030
Zeljko Ivezic: So if I looked in this diagram above

145
00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:02.469
Zeljko Ivezic: here on the in the left panel, all these points are the same to me.

146
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.680
Zeljko Ivezic: I simply count how many points fall in each pixel.

147
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.040
Zeljko Ivezic: But someone could have told me that

148
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:22.890
Zeljko Ivezic: some of these are stars and some are galaxies, and then I put color code by the majority count, and maybe one cluster would be one type, one label and the other cluster would be different label.

149
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:31.849
Zeljko Ivezic: Or maybe we would discover the direction for clusters, and we have 4 different labels. So that would be classification based on these labels.

150
00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.839
Zeljko Ivezic: We don't have labels here. That's why it's called clustering.

151
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:47.890
Zeljko Ivezic: unsupervised classification. But this diagram in the bottom shows example of supervised classification, so that 2 types of points, like points and and grade points.

152
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:57.580
Zeljko Ivezic: And so these are 2 different labels. They could be vegetables, sand, fruit. In this example there are 2 different types of stars.

153
00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:04.520
Zeljko Ivezic: You could do something in chemistry and get different chemical composition. So you have 2 coordinates that you measure.

154
00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.650
Zeljko Ivezic: and in addition to these coordinates.

155
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:18.110
Zeljko Ivezic: you also have labeled, I tell you this measurement is blackpoint, and the other measurement is gray points for them in this diagram, and then you see that there are 2 clouds.

156
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:26.350
Zeljko Ivezic: and then I ask you to find the best separation between these 2 clouds in this diagram.

157
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:39.300
Zeljko Ivezic: That will give me, then, future classifications. If I have new data points when it falls in this diagram, I will know immediately which class it belongs to that supervised classification.

158
00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:46.180
Zeljko Ivezic: And here, too, there are many methods. and we'll learn some of them, and that will be topic next week.

159
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:55.320
Zeljko Ivezic: So these are the basic parts of machine learning that we want to cover, or at least know that they exist.

160
00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:07.440
Zeljko Ivezic: Now, many of these methods, if not all. are already implemented in public vote. So I suppose most of you learn heard about psychic learn.

161
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.150
Zeljko Ivezic: So it's

162
00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:23.690
Zeljko Ivezic: professional grade code that is organized in these topics that I just covered. So you can now click on classification or regression, or what you are doing. And then you can find even many more methods that we can cover in this class.

163
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:32.510
Zeljko Ivezic: So the purpose of these lectures is not to teach you in very detail about every of these methods. We can't do that in 6 h.

164
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:48.629
Zeljko Ivezic: But what we can do is to make you aware of the existence of these methodologies. So when you face some numerical problem in your own analysis, in your own context, then you will remember and say, Oh, that sounds like classification.

165
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:54.049
Zeljko Ivezic: or I need to do clustering, or oh, that sounds like by Asian blocks. I remember that.

166
00:24:54.060 --> 00:25:03.479
Zeljko Ivezic: And then you go back, and then you know where to start, and then you start digging, either in lecture. So you jump straight to psychic learn, etc. So there's the idea.

167
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:09.259
Zeljko Ivezic: And also, as we discussed it at the beginning of the whole series in April.

168
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:36.360
Zeljko Ivezic: If you really want to learn it, you have to try it yourself. So when you get home, take these notebooks. You can't break them. If you break them, you delete them and download them again. So try to change things, try to run it. Try. The best is, if you have your own research problem. And you take your own data that you understand, and then try to run some of these methods and see how it works on your data set. That's by far the best way to learn.

169
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:44.650
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's intro to class today. So let me now pause and see if there are questions.

170
00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:54.279
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay. Now let's continue. So we'll start by

171
00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:02.970
Zeljko Ivezic: search infrastructure in one dimensional data, and then we'll go to slightly more complicated example.

172
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:12.030
Zeljko Ivezic: And the last example will be 2 dimensional example of galaxies on the sky. So I just put this as

173
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:19.770
Zeljko Ivezic: motivation for what we want to do. So here we have 2 coordinates X and y. These are

174
00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:26.620
Zeljko Ivezic: dial. That's 2 coordinates out of 3 dimensional space. So we observe galaxies on the sky.

175
00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:33.630
Zeljko Ivezic: and we measure position on the sky. And then from their redshift from their spectra, you can tell how far they are.

176
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:41.129
Zeljko Ivezic: So now we have 2 dimensions on the sky, plus the radial direction for each galaxy. So basically, you can tap out the box

177
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:47.310
Zeljko Ivezic: and you have 3 dimensional distribution. And then it was found. And actually it was one

178
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:59.649
Zeljko Ivezic: kid from Zagreb called Mario Yurich. He's not kid anymore. But he was playing with this sample for his Ph. D. And realized that there is huge clustering of galaxies. In this one specific space of

179
00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:14.170
Zeljko Ivezic: the location of volume probe by phone, digital sky Survey. Small digital Sky Survey was the first large spectroscopic survey of galaxies. So the sample jumped for a few 1,000 galaxies with spectra to a million

180
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:18.939
Zeljko Ivezic: sample of 1 million galaxies spectra, and in early 2,000.

181
00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.830
Zeljko Ivezic: And so then everybody was looking at this distribution.

182
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:28.079
Zeljko Ivezic: and before that there was similar structure, but about 10 times smaller.

183
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:41.160
Zeljko Ivezic: discovered in so-called Harvard survey of galaxies with few 1,000 galaxies. But now that there's the assess sample came online, this was this is the largest structure in the universe, the largest, non random

184
00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:45.040
Zeljko Ivezic: structure of galaxies that we know of. You can see that it's about

185
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:50.269
Zeljko Ivezic: 200 megapar 6 long. Now the question is, how big is megaparsec?

186
00:27:50.380 --> 00:28:05.100
Zeljko Ivezic: So our galaxy is about point 3 megaparsecs large. and the nearest large galaxy and drama. That galaxy is one megaparsec far from us, and this is few 100 megapars.

187
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.410
Zeljko Ivezic: So there are about 10,000 dots in this structure.

188
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:23.140
Zeljko Ivezic: So let's ask the physics behind it. But this could be anything else. You can take a you could take a hand off so, or fan, throw on your table, make a picture with your iphone, and then ask, Is it random, or does it have structure?

189
00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.570
Zeljko Ivezic: So we want to take this point.

190
00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:32.540
Zeljko Ivezic: and we want to turn this point process into a continuous distribution of density in this diver.

191
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:35.169
Zeljko Ivezic: and do so later. Many methods how to do it.

192
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:42.119
Zeljko Ivezic: Before we go to 2D. We'll play a little bit with one dimensional data set.

193
00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:48.769
Zeljko Ivezic: and often in one-dimensional data sets. It's pretty much what we call histogram.

194
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:53.100
Zeljko Ivezic: and everybody loves and does Instagram.

195
00:28:53.250 --> 00:29:05.319
Zeljko Ivezic: But we often do not really think about what exactly we do. When we say I'll make a histogram. You can take your excel spreadsheet and excel spreadsheet will make your histogram.

196
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:10.840
Zeljko Ivezic: You can ask yourself, why do I have as many bins as excel proposed

197
00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:21.309
Zeljko Ivezic: in early versions of Excel spreadsheet. The algorithm was that, independent of any data set, you may provide, the number of bins is 10.

198
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:27.410
Zeljko Ivezic: So that was a Microsoft programmer, who decided that the optimal number of these is 10 and that's it.

199
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:35.969
Zeljko Ivezic: But in reality we can do much better. We can actually compute optimal bandwidth for our dataset.

200
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:46.219
Zeljko Ivezic: and we can do also much better than classical histogram. Classical histogram is essentially modeling your data distribution by step function.

201
00:29:46.740 --> 00:30:07.200
Zeljko Ivezic: So you have from this point to this point I have box. The next step is a box, and next step is a box box. Typically, you define the centers of these boxes, and you define the width of these boxes, and then you just throw your data into these boxes, and you count how many of your data points fell in each box.

202
00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:21.009
Zeljko Ivezic: That's what histogram is, and then it takes fair root of that number. You assume voice sound statistics, and that gives you error bar on top of your account. And that's what 99% of people do when they do histograms.

203
00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.420
Zeljko Ivezic: But you can show that

204
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:39.790
Zeljko Ivezic: you get different results. You take some random sample, you change slightly, bin position and morphology of your histogram change. You change slightly the width of the morphology of your data changes. Sometimes

205
00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:42.710
Zeljko Ivezic: you get some peaks like the one in here.

206
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.369
Zeljko Ivezic: and you ask yourself.

207
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:54.319
Zeljko Ivezic: Is this for real, or is it just random situations? So how do you answer all these questions principally is what we want to cover next.

208
00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:06.240
Zeljko Ivezic: So here is just example of what happens when you change placement of your base. So in these 2 panels.

209
00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.150
Zeljko Ivezic: It's exactly the same data set.

210
00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:18.080
Zeljko Ivezic: It's exactly the same bin web. But you just shift. It bends a little bit and you get totally different conclusion. You go from this to

211
00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:25.599
Zeljko Ivezic: modes to something that maybe has a peak or not, etc. So this is just to convince you that one has to be careful.

212
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.960
Zeljko Ivezic: And so statisticians have been thinking about

213
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:47.549
Zeljko Ivezic: how to estimate what is the optimal bin with, given a data set. And so by optimal, it means the minimizing the difference between the resulting histogram and your true density distribution from which you draw your data.

214
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:59.279
Zeljko Ivezic: And so, most famous one, the oldest one, is so called Scott's rule after Guy. His last name is Scott. and it says, Take the standard deviation of your sample.

215
00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:05.279
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's Sigma. and divide by N to the third one-third power.

216
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:21.000
Zeljko Ivezic: and that will give you the optimal width of your bill. It comes from statistics. It assumes Gaussian distribution, and that's the result now later, maybe 20 years ago, Friedman and Joconi said.

217
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:27.009
Zeljko Ivezic: but that doesn't work. If you have very non-gaussian distribution, if you have very thick tails.

218
00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:34.399
Zeljko Ivezic: you know that one data point which is outlier can take standard deviation of your sample essentially to infinity.

219
00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:46.490
Zeljko Ivezic: You can have beautiful Gaussian distribution. But take 1 point and bring it to infinity, and the whole Sigma, the standard deviation will become infinity. So that's not a robust statistic.

220
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:51.059
Zeljko Ivezic: Much better one is, if you look at the median and 2 quart files.

221
00:32:51.360 --> 00:33:03.100
Zeljko Ivezic: They are not sensitive to our players. So if you fear that your data set as outliers, then you use this optimized formula. Now that is robust to outliers.

222
00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:07.159
Zeljko Ivezic: And so these 2 are the most frequent

223
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:12.299
Zeljko Ivezic: approaches to histograms woke up.

224
00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:13.310
and

225
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:24.540
Zeljko Ivezic: you are optimizing so-called loss function, which in this case they assume mean integrated square error.

226
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:34.860
Zeljko Ivezic: So you take some distribution. In first case, Gaussian, in the other case something more general. and then you say, for each bin given some bin width.

227
00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:46.699
Zeljko Ivezic: I will calculate. What is the difference between the predicted count and the observed count. And you say I want to minimize that function, and then, by minimizing this

228
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:51.179
Zeljko Ivezic: mean loss, you derive condition on your template.

229
00:33:51.900 --> 00:34:01.070
Zeljko Ivezic: If you have very. If you have very large binaries, like only few bins, you will never. You will not pick up the structure in your data set.

230
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:04.939
Zeljko Ivezic: but if you go and make it very, very narrow impact.

231
00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:21.030
Zeljko Ivezic: Then you will have a lot of Poisson fluctuations, and that will increase the error. So there is Optimal bill which is not too large, which is not too small, that minimizes mean, integrated, spare error. And that's what gives you this formula. You derive it from that formula.

232
00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:29.169
Zeljko Ivezic: Just take first derivative, objective. and there is a reference to original paper, if you want to see detailed derivation.

233
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:34.420
Zeljko Ivezic: and so then later, we generalize this further.

234
00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:39.369
Zeljko Ivezic: So now another method for estimating density is

235
00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:47.980
Zeljko Ivezic: so similar result at the end it looks somewhat similar to histogram, in a sense that for each position here

236
00:34:48.210 --> 00:35:07.829
Zeljko Ivezic: I have some numbers for this position. I know the height for this position. I know the height for this position. I know the height, but in each case I only count points that fell in this bin and data points in this bin and data points in that bin have nothing to do with the middle points with the middle bin.

237
00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:24.379
Zeljko Ivezic: The height of this bin is determined only by points in that bin, not by these points or these points. And that's not optimal, because sometimes the neighborhood also will give you some information about the local density variation.

238
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:29.620
Zeljko Ivezic: so it can be shown relatively easily that better.

239
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:39.349
Zeljko Ivezic: less noisy estimate of density is so-called kernel density estimation. And that's basically generalizing histogram, which is just a box

240
00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.899
Zeljko Ivezic: to some more general function.

241
00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:52.170
Zeljko Ivezic: When you do histogram. And you have this box PIN, basically you go through all your data points. And you say if it fell in that bin

242
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:59.029
Zeljko Ivezic: a data point, then it's weight is one. If it fell outside that bin. Its weight is 0.

243
00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:08.560
Zeljko Ivezic: And you for basically just counting points. But that's equivalent to giving weight. That is either one or 0 depending whether it's been.

244
00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:19.940
Zeljko Ivezic: but we can generalize and give a smooth waiting function that will extend beyond that single bin. and then you have a smooth fallout of these weights as you go out.

245
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:24.639
Zeljko Ivezic: and that will improve your estimate of that integrated square error.

246
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:34.979
Zeljko Ivezic: And so basically, this formula now maybe looks ugly. But it's nothing more than saying, go through all of your data points.

247
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.470
Zeljko Ivezic: Take some function that we call kernel

248
00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:43.170
Zeljko Ivezic: and evaluate the value of that function.

249
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:53.499
Zeljko Ivezic: And that's your weight, basically assuming weights between 0 and one rather than weight, that are either 0 or one using Instagram.

250
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:57.819
Zeljko Ivezic: And then the question is, how do you define kernel?

251
00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:06.530
Zeljko Ivezic: And then that kernel can be wide. It can be narrow, just like means can be narrow and wide. You need to optimize over it. And

252
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:13.000
Zeljko Ivezic: there are multiple choices for kernels. So these are some

253
00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:21.779
Zeljko Ivezic: usually use practice kernels. All of them have common features. They're high in the middle and then fall off. I think I even have a plot

254
00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:26.200
Zeljko Ivezic: here. So this is typical kernel. Here we have 3.

255
00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:33.030
Zeljko Ivezic: So they're defined between minus one and one, because later you will scale it by some arbitrary width.

256
00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:47.469
Zeljko Ivezic: and they are peaked in the center, and then they have tails that fall off. So most popular one are Gaussian and exponential, and top head corresponds to regular spinning in histograms. But it can be shown that there is optimal kernel.

257
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.299
Zeljko Ivezic: About 50 60 years ago Russian mathematician, Epaneknikov.

258
00:37:52.740 --> 00:38:04.610
Zeljko Ivezic: showed that if you assume some kernel and then you go to a more involved optimization like with Instagram. But you still ask, what is the minimum? Spare error.

259
00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:16.910
Zeljko Ivezic: then you get that result is this parabola. Second order parabola. Fortunately, I don't have it in this plot, but it looks like this thick line in the center, but drops to 0

260
00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:34.600
Zeljko Ivezic: at minus one and one. So basically, it's hoots out this corner on the top tax. And because of this smoothing, it's much, let's send it to random shifting data points, and then you get minimum possible square error.

261
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:46.559
Zeljko Ivezic: And the one thing to take home from kernel discussion is that it's not super important. What's the shape of kernel?

262
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:59.430
Zeljko Ivezic: More important thing is to get the optimal width of kernel, which is the same as same for histogram you want optimal with. and that's done through various optimizations, usually cross validation.

263
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:08.899
Zeljko Ivezic: So now, to go from just talking to actual examples. we will return to example. I think we covered in lecture 5 or 6.

264
00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:22.180
Zeljko Ivezic: This is a bunch of exponential distributions, I think, Dan or Gaussian. and through Pdf. here it is. Okay. Yeah, there are all Pushi distributions or

265
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.180
Zeljko Ivezic: exponential distributions.

266
00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:30.139
Zeljko Ivezic: No, no, just for she. So it has very thick tails.

267
00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:35.309
Zeljko Ivezic: And so there are 4 of them. And this is true. So this is some function

268
00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:40.889
Zeljko Ivezic: that we cooked up. And now we will draw data points from that function

269
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:47.359
Zeljko Ivezic: randomly, and we'll ask ourselves how well, we can reproduce that function.

270
00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.430
Zeljko Ivezic: And so we'll use

271
00:39:52.470 --> 00:40:05.470
Zeljko Ivezic: Gaussian kernel. And if you look at the code, this is not rocket science. So it's the only specific line is this one which encapsulates in Astro, Ml.

272
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:16.530
Zeljko Ivezic: Integration over kernel. So it's just little numerical integration you give it. What's the bit? And you tell it which shape, and then it fills

273
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:20.329
Zeljko Ivezic: fit the the values on

274
00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:22.849
Zeljko Ivezic: based on the data set.

275
00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:30.819
Zeljko Ivezic: And so when we run this, this is what you get. So we look at 2 samples like before.

276
00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:35.040
Zeljko Ivezic: Let me see if I can make this smaller. No.

277
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:37.600
Zeljko Ivezic: hmm.

278
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:49.849
Zeljko Ivezic: I don't know what's happening. Okay, this happened. You can see at the bottom of each panel

279
00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:53.140
Zeljko Ivezic: these little black box. These are data points.

280
00:40:53.450 --> 00:41:02.500
Zeljko Ivezic: You can see that you get most of them close to the peak of their function, because we are simply drawing random. So to just to show what we

281
00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:14.119
Zeljko Ivezic: true from that from that distribution you have these little vertical marks at the bottom. And there are 2 data sets. First, one is 500 points, and the other one is 5,000 points.

282
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:25.330
Zeljko Ivezic: Just to show how results depend on your data size. And so in the top panel, the solid line shows the results of that kernel integration.

283
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:29.650
Zeljko Ivezic: So as you go from left to right, from left to right

284
00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:31.760
Zeljko Ivezic: you have position of colonel.

285
00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:38.280
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you give to each point you give. Wait! That corresponds to that position of kernel, and then you add it up.

286
00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:44.529
Zeljko Ivezic: So instead of having box, you have something smoother, and the result follows pretty much

287
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:50.790
Zeljko Ivezic: the underlying function, the dotted line, but not perfectly, because we have only 500 points, of course.

288
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:52.690
Zeljko Ivezic: And then

289
00:41:53.070 --> 00:42:02.810
Zeljko Ivezic: in this example you have 5,000 points. And now it's almost perfect. Now you clearly resolve the central part. etcetera. And then there are

290
00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:09.279
Zeljko Ivezic: this. One is point one with you can later change the width of kernel and see what it does.

291
00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:14.230
Zeljko Ivezic: As you increase the kernel with, you will be losing this central point.

292
00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:19.609
Zeljko Ivezic: central Peak. But this will become less noisy. So it's always

293
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:27.449
Zeljko Ivezic: optimization between bias and between scatter. So again, you minimize the mean, spare error. To get optimal with

294
00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:42.370
Zeljko Ivezic: the best thing to do would be to run by Asian blocks, and we'll get to that in like 5 min. Good question.

295
00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:52.639
Zeljko Ivezic: So another, then method that you can use is nearest neighbor density distribution.

296
00:42:52.660 --> 00:43:01.600
Zeljko Ivezic: so that works also in multi-dimensional cases. So I'm here, and I want to determine density

297
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:03.889
Zeljko Ivezic: of points around me.

298
00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:30.660
Zeljko Ivezic: So one way is to say, I will count 10 meters around myself how many people are. So I would get bunch of you here first 3 people. There will be some density if I go to the center there, and then draw a circle. Then I'll get 20 people. So density there is higher than here, and then you'll just go through the entire grid, and you will count how many data points you have within given volume, boundary dimension.

299
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.729
Zeljko Ivezic: When you have hugely dimensional

300
00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:51.780
Zeljko Ivezic: volume, then you start suffering from something called curse of dimensionality, where a sphere in multi dimensional case of a given size will have smaller and smaller and smaller volume enclosed in it. So this breaks down for highly multi-dimensional cases.

301
00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:58.110
Zeljko Ivezic: But in all dimensional cases it's as simple and Si same in this volume. How many data points? Okay?

302
00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:13.139
Zeljko Ivezic: And then there is a there is a improvement of that method. When you don't say I will count how many people I have within 10 meter radius. But you say I will take the 10 nearest people

303
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:15.029
Zeljko Ivezic: and look at their

304
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:26.309
Zeljko Ivezic: distances from me, and then I can do by Asian approach to possible statistics, and I can get the best mean local density. That's another improvement of that method here.

305
00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:32.780
Zeljko Ivezic: These 2 panels show the result of of that nearest neighbor determination

306
00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.340
Zeljko Ivezic: with 10 neighbors.

307
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:36.700
Zeljko Ivezic: and

308
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:42.490
Zeljko Ivezic: you can see that it's a bit noisier than than current kernel density estimator.

309
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.029
Zeljko Ivezic: And it it has to be that way because

310
00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:53.079
Zeljko Ivezic: kernel density estimation is optimal from from the point of view of that mean, integrated, square error.

311
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:56.589
Zeljko Ivezic: Of course, when you have lots of data points, then

312
00:44:57.590 --> 00:45:02.470
Zeljko Ivezic: any method that is that that is good will converge to the same result.

313
00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:08.449
Zeljko Ivezic: And so then we'll come to the most powerful of these methods called Bayesian blocks.

314
00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:14.819
Zeljko Ivezic: So that will come to your question, and we already talked about this in lecture 5 or 6 I forget.

315
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.259
Zeljko Ivezic: So here we say.

316
00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:29.879
Zeljko Ivezic: we will have something like histogram. So step function will describe my model for underlying density distribution. But I'm not going to specify what's the width

317
00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.199
Zeljko Ivezic: off these steps.

318
00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:33.939
Zeljko Ivezic: And actually.

319
00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:38.700
Zeljko Ivezic: in this method, you say, I'm not even going to force the same bit

320
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:41.269
Zeljko Ivezic: I will allow, variable with.

321
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:47.330
Zeljko Ivezic: and the simplest model that is still consistent with the data.

322
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:53.120
Zeljko Ivezic: And so that method is fully by Asian and given a dataset

323
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.720
Zeljko Ivezic: statistically, you can't beat it.

324
00:45:56.330 --> 00:46:04.389
Zeljko Ivezic: The only downside of that method is that nobody has, as far as I know, generalized to multi-dimensional spaces.

325
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:16.619
Zeljko Ivezic: Even one dimensional case, when you look at derivation of the final equations is like 5 pages of of analytical derivation until it gets to the final loss function you optimize.

326
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:22.990
Zeljko Ivezic: So I don't. I don't know if there is multi-dimensional case, but for one dimensional data set you cannot beat it.

327
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:41.930
Zeljko Ivezic: And so here is example of it in action. So the gray histogram looking thing is not classical histogram. This is result of blocks, calculation, and the main difference compared to here you have body.

328
00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:47.340
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you look at this middle. at this middle feature.

329
00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:58.929
Zeljko Ivezic: it has a very narrow PIN that protrudes up and describes the day on the left side where you don't have that many data points. It's one very wide bin.

330
00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:02.460
Zeljko Ivezic: So given these few data points in here.

331
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:13.130
Zeljko Ivezic: what blocks is telling you that there is no statistical evidence for any substructure in that part of the time.

332
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:15.939
Zeljko Ivezic: But here you have enough data points

333
00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:21.989
Zeljko Ivezic: that there is strong statistical belief that there is feature in the middle.

334
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.060
Zeljko Ivezic: And that's why this method is so powerful.

335
00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:40.129
Zeljko Ivezic: Because if you have a motor, it's data set. Other methods might not pick up this middle peak. Let's say you're doing some chemical analysis of some sample. You did spectrometer measurement. And you have data like this, and you're asking yourself.

336
00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:48.670
Zeljko Ivezic: do I have? Is, for example, that correspond to goals, or whatever do I have statistical evidence in my measurement?

337
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:52.710
Zeljko Ivezic: And so by Asian blocks is the optimal statistical method.

338
00:47:53.720 --> 00:48:01.219
Zeljko Ivezic: Again, if you have lots of data, then you don't need statistics than any method to work. If you have large sample.

339
00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:04.250
Zeljko Ivezic: but for moderate size sam samples

340
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:24.669
Zeljko Ivezic: it. It, it's different. And so here now all 3 of them are shown together. So if you look at the bottom panel with 5,000 data points. All these methods tell you pretty much the same thing. But if your sample is small, then you can benefit greatly from using an optimal method.

341
00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:31.750
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you just apply classical histogram analysis to the top panel, you would miss the middle panel.

342
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:35.880
Zeljko Ivezic: Maybe it's a new particle in Cern, and you miss your Nobel Prize.

343
00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.380
Zeljko Ivezic: so Bayesian blocks is your friend

344
00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:53.989
Zeljko Ivezic: again. Unfortunately, the Yesan blocs is only implemented in in oned. If you have multi dimensional data set. then you cannot use via Zoombox. But there are other methods we can use.

345
00:48:54.040 --> 00:49:01.410
Zeljko Ivezic: and one is just to make an assumption about how is your underlying distribution

346
00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:06.440
Zeljko Ivezic: looking. And then you can fit analytic functions to those data points.

347
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:20.530
Zeljko Ivezic: And so again, this is where Gaussian is used. If you can assume that your clumps can be described as linear combinations of multivariate multi-dimensional Gaussians. Then you can just use Gaussian mixture model.

348
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:26.410
Zeljko Ivezic: And that's basically what these equations. Show. So the first one says.

349
00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:32.519
Zeljko Ivezic: there is this end of new and stands for normal distribution of.

350
00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:43.210
Zeljko Ivezic: And

351
00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:47.139
Zeljko Ivezic: and you say I will describe my

352
00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:57.160
Zeljko Ivezic: distribution. So key of my data expand. Given some model parameters, Stepa stands for New and Sigma.

353
00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:06.439
Zeljko Ivezic: I will describe that as being drawn from a multi dimensional, and then I will minimize.

354
00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:10.910
Zeljko Ivezic: I will minimize the box function like

355
00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:15.729
Zeljko Ivezic: to get my model of parameters. And so that's easy to do.

356
00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:23.340
Zeljko Ivezic: But then you ask yourself, how do I know what this N. The capital? And how do I know how many?

357
00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:29.659
Zeljko Ivezic: And the answer is, I don't, but I can try some reasonable range

358
00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:36.320
Zeljko Ivezic: of M say, up to 100, for example, depending on data set. And then I can calculate

359
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:47.569
Zeljko Ivezic: by Asian information criterion or the full model probability for each of these choices. And then, wherever the thing is minimized, this is my statistically optimal choice.

360
00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:50.370
Zeljko Ivezic: And so that's what next

361
00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:53.780
Zeljko Ivezic: example is doing. So BIC,

362
00:50:55.050 --> 00:51:17.819
Zeljko Ivezic: it's 2 times like the maximum likelihood. And that's essentially Chi square. So you can write. VI see, is defined 5 square in case of data, not generally. But when you have lots of data, Vsc is 5 square, we know, maybe.

363
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:30.690
Zeljko Ivezic: But the difference between Vic and Chi-square is this additional term, plus K. Times L and N, and is the size of your data sample. How many data points you have?

364
00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:34.750
Zeljko Ivezic: And K is the number of free model parameters.

365
00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:53.710
Zeljko Ivezic: So again we discussed it before. But to remind you, Vic, is numerical implementation of the so-called principle that you should use. You should choose the simplest model that is capable of explaining your data.

366
00:51:54.650 --> 00:52:07.959
Zeljko Ivezic: So like you can make more complicated model, which may even have a little bit smaller price fair, because more model parameters. We have the better you should see the data, but eventually you'll start over 50

367
00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:16.100
Zeljko Ivezic: and let's control by this penalty. K. And N. So you don't need to go with very complicated

368
00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:27.119
Zeljko Ivezic: model, because it will punish you through bic like. For example, this morning in newspapers. Judge Turodic want to be selected.

369
00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:30.509
Zeljko Ivezic: And now he says I didn't know

370
00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:41.430
Zeljko Ivezic: Mrs. Rimat or I did, or we did talk, then we shouldn't, and so on. Who do you believe him, or

371
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:51.210
Zeljko Ivezic: 99% of Croatian guilty of doing improper things or not. That's one good example of where you can apply. BIC, and get to the answer.

372
00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:55.989
Zeljko Ivezic: I'll leave that for home.

373
00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:01.280
Zeljko Ivezic: So here there is a problem in us right now.

374
00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:06.019
Zeljko Ivezic: I screwed up something on my computer, and I have this new

375
00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:19.559
Zeljko Ivezic: and ask right now did not work the way it's supposed to. So I copied this from past premise distribution. It's literal copy. It's just growing and ellipse. You shouldn't even know about it. But since I broke it on my computer, I had to copy.

376
00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:24.090
Zeljko Ivezic: So we will be looking now at this example.

377
00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:30.339
Zeljko Ivezic: So again, details of movements are not important, but it's real. Time

378
00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:40.639
Zeljko Ivezic: is measurements of the chemical composition of stars from spectra from small digital sky survey. So X-axis is something. Astronomers called metallicity.

379
00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:43.549
Zeljko Ivezic: That's the ratio of the number of

380
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:50.090
Zeljko Ivezic: all the atoms that are not helium or hydrogen compared to the total number of atoms.

381
00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:55.070
Zeljko Ivezic: and in in astronomy. Chemistry is very simple. There are only 3 elements

382
00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:59.690
Zeljko Ivezic: there. There is hydrogen, there is helium, and there are metals.

383
00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.109
Zeljko Ivezic: Now, of course, if you're a chemist.

384
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:11.870
Zeljko Ivezic: you know there's not anything else, but that's what you call it. And so everything but hydrogen and helium, divided by total is called metallicity.

385
00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:17.420
Zeljko Ivezic: and alpha over Fe is alpha elements like silicon carbon and other

386
00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:29.129
Zeljko Ivezic: elements that are produced in alpha reactions in nuclear reactions. And that's another interesting thing in astronomy, because it tells you how fast was star formation process.

387
00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:32.750
Zeljko Ivezic: So basically. this is kind of

388
00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:38.949
Zeljko Ivezic: how all this population and how quickly it was point. Not exactly. But that's why we plug this time.

389
00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:51.480
Zeljko Ivezic: But in this context we don't even care what it is. It's a bunch of points, few tens of thousands of points. And I can see by my eyes that there is some structure in it. What that we want to do it is to quantify it.

390
00:54:51.810 --> 00:55:02.830
Zeljko Ivezic: So we say, well, in that kind of round clusters. So maybe Gaussian distribution is not totally insane. Let's try to fit it with a bunch of Gaussians, and let's see how it looks like

391
00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:12.149
Zeljko Ivezic: how many Gaussians? Well, we don't know. So let's do it for many options. And then see how Bic behaves. And that's what's done in here.

392
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:19.410
Zeljko Ivezic: So basically, you loop over actually, calculation was done earlier here. Now, where is it?

393
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:26.279
Zeljko Ivezic: Here? It's this is calculation. I'm not going to do it again, because it's slovish to take few minutes.

394
00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:28.510
Zeljko Ivezic: You can try it later yourself.

395
00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:33.379
Zeljko Ivezic: and this is results. So y. Axis is Vic

396
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:44.010
Zeljko Ivezic: and X-axis is the number of Gaussian components. We tried. It looks like we went to 13. Aic is added just for

397
00:55:44.410 --> 00:56:01.910
Zeljko Ivezic: for completeness. Aic is an older quantity called Aikaki information criterion that was derived using different approach, not by Asia. It gives you very similar answer, but it's not as principle as by A/C. So I usually use Bic when I do these things.

398
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:15.349
Zeljko Ivezic: So we look at the solid line and we see that we kind of hit. It's not exactly local minimum. At what is it? 5, but event out. And assuming that this is now kind of noisy thing.

399
00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:19.049
Zeljko Ivezic: it looks like 4 or 5 Gaussians should work.

400
00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:23.079
Zeljko Ivezic: And so here in this one, it's 5.

401
00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:38.179
Zeljko Ivezic: So now we just take that case for 5 Gaussians. And we say what these ellipses in this diagram and show me how it looks. The finalness of the distribution. And so this is what you get.

402
00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:41.100
Zeljko Ivezic: and the next

403
00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:45.270
Zeljko Ivezic: compares the 2. So links is

404
00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:48.090
Zeljko Ivezic: real data.

405
00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:51.079
Zeljko Ivezic: 2 dimensional. Just count.

406
00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:57.479
Zeljko Ivezic: And then you see Gaussians, please. Then, you see, Gaussians, you don't actually use females don't have to stimulate.

407
00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:01.460
Zeljko Ivezic: You simply give it X and y's for all the data points.

408
00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:03.240
Zeljko Ivezic: And you conclude that

409
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:13.340
Zeljko Ivezic: so basically, given the size of the morphology, this diagram find

410
00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:24.590
Zeljko Ivezic: and but I'm looking at it. I should have added another panel to see the residuals.

411
00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:33.009
Zeljko Ivezic: So that would have been good plus, too. Now I I'll have to write a note for myself. Give me a second.

412
00:57:51.880 --> 00:58:03.780
Zeljko Ivezic: Alright. So there is one more thing I want to do today. So this is powerful method. Before see many dynamics before the large data sets, you can.

413
00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:13.530
Zeljko Ivezic: One thing that is not good to Gaussian, although, is that we assume that the measurements of X and Y axis

414
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:20.720
Zeljko Ivezic: has small uncertainties so small that they are negligible compared to the data spread.

415
00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:28.880
Zeljko Ivezic: So here we have data going from minus one to 0. So let's say, we assume there is a point on one or smaller.

416
00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:35.289
Zeljko Ivezic: We did not introduce any errors in this analysis only to the measured positions.

417
00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:43.259
Zeljko Ivezic: Now, often in science we don't have perfect measurements. Often our errors can be substantial, especially

418
00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:45.889
Zeljko Ivezic: very expensive to to get smoked.

419
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:59.180
Zeljko Ivezic: So we want a method. Now that would look at this distribution. But assuming that for each data point, we have error or uncertainty or measurement. We want to work it into our analysis.

420
00:58:59.450 --> 00:59:02.010
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you just if you just look at this diagram.

421
00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:18.890
Zeljko Ivezic: if we now edit errors X and Y, that would blur the whole distribution, it would move, points up and down, and as a result the final Gaussian would become set up bigger because they would be spread out.

422
00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:28.909
Zeljko Ivezic: But if I tell everybody else far I should be, it should be possible to account for this in it effectively, we should be able to deep on Mobile

423
00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:34.410
Zeljko Ivezic: like. If I have 2 Gaussian distributions. Let's say I have Gaussian with one.

424
00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:38.529
Zeljko Ivezic: and my measurements have certain value. With 2,

425
00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:44.220
Zeljko Ivezic: the result will be convolution of 2 gases. which is again a Gaussian.

426
00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:48.569
Zeljko Ivezic: with the bit that is fair root of the sum of squares of the bit

427
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:55.079
Zeljko Ivezic: that's analytic result of Gauss. So at least in principle, I should be able. If I know

428
00:59:55.340 --> 01:00:06.810
Zeljko Ivezic: errors, I should say, then it's square root of the top of it, minus square errors. That's intrinsically based in principle. And that's what happens with extreme data convolution.

429
01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:14.909
Zeljko Ivezic: So what we are doing is very similar model. I don't even know if you can see.

430
01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:15.980
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay.

431
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:20.249
Zeljko Ivezic: So we again assume that second line.

432
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:26.179
Zeljko Ivezic: First, the same measurements are coming from some distribution, and they have errors.

433
01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:37.210
Zeljko Ivezic: Then my model looks exactly the same as before some of Gaussians, but the difference is that the weight of that Gaussian is now added in quadrature

434
01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:46.289
Zeljko Ivezic: between errors and something intrinsic errors. We are given, and we are looking for the intrinsic bit. So we are looking at something that was

435
01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:50.949
Zeljko Ivezic: blurred by X, and we are looking for the underlying distribution.

436
01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.250
Zeljko Ivezic: And so this is slightly

437
01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:58.480
Zeljko Ivezic: more involved to solve, but not fundamentally different.

438
01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:01.349
Zeljko Ivezic: And so we will look at

439
01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:05.060
Zeljko Ivezic: one example

440
01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:11.269
Zeljko Ivezic: that was motivated by stellar photometry in astronomy. But again, it's X and y.

441
01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.220
Zeljko Ivezic: and this is through this provision. So there is something very inevitable.

442
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:32.880
Zeljko Ivezic: and then there is a cloud, so there is very elegant. not quite Gaussian, but very narrow distribution along the line, and then there is a big clump. And so this is true. We drew that distribution from some analytic thingy.

443
01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:40.340
Zeljko Ivezic: and now we'll add errors. So now you, if you compare the 2, you can see how narrow this one is.

444
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:45.959
Zeljko Ivezic: but now it becomes very wide, and the reason is that we introduce them.

445
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:49.100
Zeljko Ivezic: Be sad, let me say sad Arabs

446
01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:11.079
Zeljko Ivezic: between point 2 and point 7, and then we drove from Gaussian random number. We add it to x 2.2, and we get pretend measurements

447
01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:15.419
Zeljko Ivezic: that patron from some known distribution, but then they are blurred.

448
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:19.950
Zeljko Ivezic: And so the idea is that we take measurements like this.

449
01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:24.110
Zeljko Ivezic: where we know measurement, uncertainties, and we derived

450
01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:35.579
Zeljko Ivezic: back this underlying distribution. So in effect, we are deconvolving observed distribution, while at the same time we are also modeling the underlying distribution.

451
01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:58.959
Zeljko Ivezic: And that's what's called in in astronomy that people who re this method was known in statistics for like half a century. But it became popular in astronomy. Maybe 20 years ago, when computers allowed you to model this huge data set. And so the guys who who wrote it called it extreme deconvolution

452
01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:11.360
Zeljko Ivezic: because they like fancy names, but there is nothing very deep and philosophical in it. It's simply deconvolution. It's modeling your data by assuming Gaussians. Your Gaussians have intrinsic and known

453
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:18.110
Zeljko Ivezic: blurring, viewed uncertainties. So let me go straight to the results. So

454
01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:20.790
Zeljko Ivezic: this is the result.

455
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:26.179
Zeljko Ivezic: The the top left panel is the distribution.

456
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:31.010
Zeljko Ivezic: So it was dropped with a beta before it measured.

457
01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:37.610
Zeljko Ivezic: So what we want to recover is stop. But we are giving the top right

458
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:47.060
Zeljko Ivezic: and let's ignore bottom list. and the bottom ground is

459
01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:53.030
Zeljko Ivezic: underlying density distribution express as the sound of galaxies.

460
01:03:53.180 --> 01:04:08.290
Zeljko Ivezic: And so we had 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, about 10 Gaussian funds to model the distribution in the top left. which is then involved with known errors to get distribution in the top right.

461
01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:12.200
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now we learn

462
01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:18.519
Zeljko Ivezic: better estimate of the undermine distribution, because errors are accounted for.

463
01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:27.790
Zeljko Ivezic: And now another Sam example is with real data. And so in this example, we have

464
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:37.179
Zeljko Ivezic: one measurement diagram, and then you can repeat measurements many times, and you can.

465
01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.990
Zeljko Ivezic: And so in this small part of the study

466
01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:51.769
Zeljko Ivezic: panel are exactly the same. But in the next panel. They measure 50 times 7 months only.

467
01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:54.339
Zeljko Ivezic: and in the right is

468
01:04:54.500 --> 01:05:09.999
Zeljko Ivezic: measurement. Errors are negligible.

469
01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:15.259
Zeljko Ivezic: And that's what I put in this example here. Later, you can

470
01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:18.930
Zeljko Ivezic: try to run it on some other dataset

471
01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:20.790
Zeljko Ivezic: if you have it.

472
01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:22.990
Zeljko Ivezic: So we

473
01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:39.180
Zeljko Ivezic: we start with the top right in this specific case, we know, was the right answer. It's top left. and then in front stream that convolution. And it tells us that the underlying distribution looks like bottom left. So it's much narrower.

474
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:45.870
Zeljko Ivezic: And now, if you look at the top, left most similar the net in the web and the model is shown

475
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:47.710
Zeljko Ivezic: in the autumn.

476
01:05:47.850 --> 01:06:09.709
Zeljko Ivezic: And so, even though this this hockey stick shape does not look like. If you have a series to expand it into a linear sum of guys, you can then describe any distribution. And so we said, it looks narrow. And then here in particular, this plot shows how you different works.

477
01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:13.729
Zeljko Ivezic: So the blue is just one measurement.

478
01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:21.160
Zeljko Ivezic: And we want to convolve that measurement. W is the bit of the.

479
01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:26.019
Zeljko Ivezic: So we are measuring how thick it is. So blue is the starting point.

480
01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:31.560
Zeljko Ivezic: And then multiple measurements give me orange. So orange

481
01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:42.880
Zeljko Ivezic: is maybe not the basic distribution. Maybe also has it to be prepared contribution. But we know that extremely convolution has to be a

482
01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.189
Zeljko Ivezic: and maybe now.

483
01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:48.189
Zeljko Ivezic: And indeed, the the Greek plot shows the result

484
01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:49.950
Zeljko Ivezic: correctly, because

485
01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:58.880
Zeljko Ivezic: even

486
01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:11.510
Zeljko Ivezic: expected answer. So it's a very powerful if you can describe your data as a linear sum of Gaussians, and sometimes you can use 1,000 Gaussians if need be.

487
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:13.920
Zeljko Ivezic: Yeah, I think you'll do that on Thursday.

488
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:30.839
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you trust your measurement certainties. That's important. If you're lying about measurement certainties, you get wrong. Answer. If you don't estimate measurement uncertainties properly, then, when you do convolution, you can even get square root of negative number.

489
01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:39.640
Zeljko Ivezic: which shouldn't happen. So you need to trust your uncertainties. And if this is true, then this is a fantastic method to use for density, estimation.

490
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:56.139
Zeljko Ivezic: and so, I believe, few minutes for questions. But let me just quickly go through this to show you what's in here. So we started lecture by showing this this 2 dimensional distribution of galaxies. Great wall. So I put together all the methods at the end.

491
01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:02.850
Zeljko Ivezic: so you can compare their performance. So we are trying to model this. So then we try Gaussian thermal.

492
01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:13.779
Zeljko Ivezic: Then we do top head kernel. Then we do exponential kernel, you can see that are very similar, and you can play with a bit if you want to make sure you can run the code.

493
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:18.329
Zeljko Ivezic: Then we also did nearest neighbor distribution.

494
01:08:19.109 --> 01:08:23.399
Zeljko Ivezic: and then we did what? What's the last one?

495
01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:30.090
Zeljko Ivezic: Oh, I'm blind like a bat nearest name, all right.

496
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:35.340
Zeljko Ivezic: And then at the end we compared all of them. So these are all kernel density estimators.

497
01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:40.029
Zeljko Ivezic: The point is to show you how it depends on the shape and width of the kernel.

498
01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:48.950
Zeljko Ivezic: And then finally, we took this distribution. That doesn't look like some of Gaussians at all, and we said, Let us run, Gaussian, make sure model and see what we get.

499
01:08:50.180 --> 01:09:03.750
Zeljko Ivezic: And so this what it came with I forget what was the number. There was some number there. No, I didn't write it. So basically, we take this point process, and then we feed Gaussian. And so in this case it looks like

500
01:09:03.779 --> 01:09:12.269
Zeljko Ivezic: I did not optimize on the width that these Gaussians are slightly too narrow, so they need to be slightly wider, and then it should work better.

501
01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:21.360
Zeljko Ivezic: And here we did 300 Gaussians. We are using some of 300 Gaussians, and that's what describes this density distribution.

502
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:32.340
Zeljko Ivezic: So that was like bunch of examples at the end. If you want to play with it and compare. So we have few minutes left. I'll stop here and you'll stop for questions.

503
01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.550
Zeljko Ivezic: Are there any questions on the zoom?

504
01:09:41.729 --> 01:09:47.600
Zeljko Ivezic: Nothing here. Okay? So then, a little bit of feedback, maybe not question but feedback.

505
01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:51.810
Zeljko Ivezic: If we cover too much today, was it too theoretically, count.

506
01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:54.369
Zeljko Ivezic: or you're just sleepy after lunch.

507
01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.830
Zeljko Ivezic: so try and try to run at least a little bit of that notebook

508
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:14.700
Zeljko Ivezic: when you have time, and then you will feel much better when you know that you have some code that you kind of understand, and you can definitely run off your company.

509
01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:20.400
Zeljko Ivezic: And for extra bonus I offer box at the reality chocolates.

510
01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:36.269
Zeljko Ivezic: If someone takes their own data from their own research, like your Phd. and you run one of these methods on your own data and explain to us in 5 to 10 min what you did and how it looks like

511
01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:39.320
Zeljko Ivezic: reality.

512
01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.470
Zeljko Ivezic: Full box.

513
01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.090
Zeljko Ivezic: All right, then we'll finish for today. Thank you so much.

514
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:52.350
Lovro Palaversa: Thank you, Jake, and bye-bye.

515
01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:53.839
Zeljko Ivezic: Thank you, Lavra.

516
01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:56.540
Ina Galić (Germany): Bye.

517
01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.360
Zeljko Ivezic: bye.
