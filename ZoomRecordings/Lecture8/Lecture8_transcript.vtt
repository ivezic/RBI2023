1
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.350
Zeljko Ivezic: Morning.

2
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:20.179
Zeljko Ivezic: I was just about to say that fewer and fewer people every time, so it's regressive you'll end up with

3
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.320
Zeljko Ivezic: to an end.

4
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.460
Zeljko Ivezic: But there are more people on campus.

5
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.999
Zeljko Ivezic: So are there any candidates for biotin awards today?

6
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.400
Zeljko Ivezic: One candidate?

7
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:45.590
Zeljko Ivezic: I did get a bunch of real. They're not candidates. We'll share them at the last lecture.

8
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.939
Zeljko Ivezic: So today we move towards classification, and it starts with so-called unsupervised classification.

9
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.570
Zeljko Ivezic: That's very similar to

10
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.939
Zeljko Ivezic: what we did last time. It's also known as clustering.

11
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.339
Zeljko Ivezic: So last time we did this example. so we had points process

12
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.509
Zeljko Ivezic: that we visualize by 2 dimensional Instagram

13
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.610
Zeljko Ivezic: basically counts in pixels in the first panel that you can see here.

14
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.929
Zeljko Ivezic: Then we tried to model that distribution with the sum of

15
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.510
Zeljko Ivezic: 2 dimensional Gaussians.

16
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.669
Zeljko Ivezic: Gaussian distributions of arbitrary orientation

17
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.900
Zeljko Ivezic: a priori. We didn't know how many

18
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.720
Zeljko Ivezic: components we need, how many clusters we have. So we computed BIC,

19
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.050
Zeljko Ivezic: and we found local minimum. And then we concluded that data support

20
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.230
Zeljko Ivezic: 4 clusters and 4 components. And that's what's shown in the right panel.

21
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.029
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's one example of clustering. We'll learn a few more methods today.

22
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:13.759
Zeljko Ivezic: The difference between density, estimation, and clustering is that there are many methods for clustering that will tell you for each point in your data set

23
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:24.020
Zeljko Ivezic: what plastically belongs to it, to tell you how many plastics they are. and it will tell you for each point in your data set which cluster it belongs to.

24
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:37.150
Zeljko Ivezic: But some methods will not tell you what is the continuous density distribution. That's the main difference. So there is overlap in this example. This is both density, estimation, method, and clustering method.

25
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.440
Zeljko Ivezic: but they are clustering methods

26
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:48.530
Zeljko Ivezic: that will not be giving you density estimate. and that's all moving us towards classification.

27
00:02:48.740 --> 00:03:02.470
Zeljko Ivezic: And so there are 2 types of classification. That's what we are going to do next Monday. So one is unsupervised, which means you don't have labels for your object. You have multi-dimensional distribution, and you ask.

28
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.580
Zeljko Ivezic: Is there any clustering in that space? The other set of methods

29
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.350
Zeljko Ivezic: assumes that there are labels for each of your objects.

30
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:35.949
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you try to find optimal separation of those clusters of those sources that are a priori label for you. That's what's called supervise classification. So eventually we'll get to classification in detail, and we'll talk about how do you measure success? We'll talk about

31
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.370
Zeljko Ivezic: concepts like false positives. false negatives.

32
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.670
Zeljko Ivezic: true positives and true negatives. So to prepare us for that

33
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.329
Zeljko Ivezic: today, we'll talk a little bit about one dimension of hypothesis testing. It's little bit of statistical

34
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.570
Zeljko Ivezic: background.

35
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:03.140
Zeljko Ivezic: and will introduce some of of that terminology so often when you.

36
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:16.949
Zeljko Ivezic: even when you have multi-dimensional datasets. you can develop some metrics. and you can reduce it to one dimensional case. So in this diagram

37
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.449
Zeljko Ivezic: we have an example of 2 populations.

38
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:32.580
Zeljko Ivezic: They are modeled by galaxies. So there is one on the left and the other one on the right they overlap. and there is some quantity X on the X axis.

39
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:42.839
Zeljko Ivezic: And so the question is, once you have a measured. X. What class of these 2 you assign?

40
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:53.380
Zeljko Ivezic: So this could be, for example, background counts and source counts in some image or something, either from astronomy or from particle physics.

41
00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:05.859
Zeljko Ivezic: or it could be measurement of some concentration in some fluid. And then you're asking if I know that my background is this population, and I have, say.

42
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:13.719
Zeljko Ivezic: value at 120. It's what statistical confidence can I assign these classes?

43
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:23.940
Zeljko Ivezic: And so the the equation above is just a. It's analytic statement of you have 2 normalized distributions.

44
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:35.499
Zeljko Ivezic: And there is this parameter, A that controls how many sources you have in practice you can have many components, but for the sake of

45
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.210
Zeljko Ivezic: introduction, we are only considering this 2 dimensional one. So let's see if we can show

46
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:55.960
Zeljko Ivezic: if you can show these equations. So let's say we put separation boundary somewhere between these 2 peaks, let's say at 100 to 20.

47
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.770
Zeljko Ivezic: Then.

48
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.970
Zeljko Ivezic: if you measure anything to the left of it.

49
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:09.160
Zeljko Ivezic: and you assign to that measurement, then you will always be correct.

50
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.959
Zeljko Ivezic: because the source distribution is already at 0 20,

51
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.119
Zeljko Ivezic: the background, the toll distribution will drop to 0 around 140.

52
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:28.669
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you are beyond 140, then you are essentially certain is your source. But in between we will be making errors.

53
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.389
Zeljko Ivezic: And so if you now say I have a source

54
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.899
Zeljko Ivezic: at that particular X, you can calculate how many spurious objects you will have.

55
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:49.269
Zeljko Ivezic: So you basically go from your boundary. XC. And you integrate what is the contribution of the background?

56
00:06:50.070 --> 00:07:00.639
Zeljko Ivezic: And so if X. See the boundary is a hundred 20, you can see this little tail on the right hand side of the top distribution.

57
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:06.280
Zeljko Ivezic: These are mistakes that you are going to be making. and we call them

58
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:18.970
Zeljko Ivezic: false positives. So we think it's source. But it's actually background. And this simple expression, just in the ground of this area, under the tail, on the right hand side.

59
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:33.720
Zeljko Ivezic: On the other hand, if you have the tail of the source distribution that extends to the left from that vertical dash line, then the bottom line will tell you how many true sources you miss.

60
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:42.390
Zeljko Ivezic: And in statistics they had these inspired names. Type one and Type 2 think it was Fisher, the statistician

61
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:48.330
Zeljko Ivezic: who developed most of these things about 100 years ago he introduced name type one and type 2,

62
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:58.349
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's what we call them in practice. Often people also call them completeness and contamination, especially in astronomy.

63
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:05.380
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you want to find sample completeness or a given boundary, let me see this picture.

64
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.720
Zeljko Ivezic: So sample completeness would be

65
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:19.950
Zeljko Ivezic: if I put Boundary here at the vertical line. What fraction of true sources I selected.

66
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:33.549
Zeljko Ivezic: and so I'm missing something on the left hand side. So in this case completeness would be fine. But we will see later in examples that completes sometimes can be as low as 50,

67
00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:45.390
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you also calculate contamination. So if I put this vertical line as the boundary, and select everything to the right, then I'm asking, what is the fraction

68
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:52.339
Zeljko Ivezic: in the total sample of that tail that is actually background, those false, positive.

69
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.259
Zeljko Ivezic: So these are true negatives. These are true

70
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:08.410
Zeljko Ivezic: positives, but this fail is full, positive is called false positives, and this fail that goes to the left in the small distribution is called 4 negatives.

71
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:13.359
Zeljko Ivezic: That's the terminology. And so these are just the ratio of these

72
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.040
Zeljko Ivezic: 4 different parts of these distributions.

73
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.039
Zeljko Ivezic: So there was some questions somewhere the year

74
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.990
Zeljko Ivezic: I so missed it. Hang on a second. Oh, motivating question!

75
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:34.270
Zeljko Ivezic: Motivating question. Let's say you measure X equals 3,

76
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.450
Zeljko Ivezic: and you know that your background

77
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.340
Zeljko Ivezic: is

78
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:57.459
Zeljko Ivezic: normal distribution centered on 0 and has some standard deviation at 2 or 2, and then your source distribution is centered at 4 and has standard deviation of one.

79
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:04.260
Zeljko Ivezic: Which population would you choose? If I give you X equals? 3. Can you work it out in your head?

80
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.510
Zeljko Ivezic: So the way you do it is, you ask

81
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:16.289
Zeljko Ivezic: how far I am from the center of the distribution in units of city.

82
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.159
Zeljko Ivezic: So for the background you have signal 2,

83
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:26.329
Zeljko Ivezic: and you have 3 3 units away. So you have 1.5. See my way from the background

84
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:37.620
Zeljko Ivezic: from the source distribution. You are one unit away and sigma one. So in units of Sigma you are one sigma away. So which one are you closer to.

85
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.670
Zeljko Ivezic: So the sort of distribution

86
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.940
Zeljko Ivezic: you sure that

87
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.959
Zeljko Ivezic: we had X equal? 3 as source? Are we missing any other information?

88
00:10:52.320 --> 00:11:04.400
Zeljko Ivezic: So the trick is that these 2 populations. they are normalized by this, a. the fraction. And so in this case

89
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.759
Zeljko Ivezic: it is not the same.

90
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:20.189
Zeljko Ivezic: If these 2 distribution are of equal strength, or if the source distribution has many fewer sources, it's called imbalanced population. And that's something that is super important in classification.

91
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:26.969
Zeljko Ivezic: So what you need to do is to equate those 2 probability distributions

92
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.620
Zeljko Ivezic: with the total number.

93
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:34.300
Zeljko Ivezic: So when you make decision boundary and say, probability

94
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:42.710
Zeljko Ivezic: is 50 over 50 for the 2 populations. It is not just probability distribution, but you need to scale it

95
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.240
Zeljko Ivezic: by the total number of objects.

96
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.869
Zeljko Ivezic: Let's think of an example.

97
00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.280
Zeljko Ivezic: Let's say you have

98
00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:07.410
Zeljko Ivezic: stars and galaxies. and you can barely resolve a galaxy. So you're not sure that you resolve this. and you have 1,000 times more stars than galaxies.

99
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:16.460
Zeljko Ivezic: And then, if stars will be scattered through random noise, little bit away from the from the true size.

100
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:30.210
Zeljko Ivezic: then you'll have in that narrow be 1,000 times higher probability that a star came into that bin than a galaxy, because these 2 samples are so imbalanced. If you had exactly the same number

101
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.360
Zeljko Ivezic: off galaxies and stars, then you would have 50 50

102
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:50.150
Zeljko Ivezic: probability distribution. But if you now boost stars but factor of 1,000, then you will have only 1,000 chance that you are correct in your claim that this is a galaxy. So you have to balance this too.

103
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:56.020
Zeljko Ivezic: So did I explain that. Well.

104
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.080
Zeljko Ivezic: some of you look about.

105
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:08.360
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's something that we'll be using later. So this concept of yes.

106
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.940
speak to all of them group.

107
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.929
Zeljko Ivezic: Often. You don't know compensation. You need to know. You'll need to have pain. Example.

108
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.510
Zeljko Ivezic: that is absolutely correct. You use product.

109
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:28.499
Zeljko Ivezic: But the point is, if you don't know it, then you cannot make probabilistic assessment of classification. That's exactly

110
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:34.070
Zeljko Ivezic: so. We'll see later some examples where how we take this into account.

111
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:40.040
Zeljko Ivezic: But it's not just a probability distribution. You have to normalize, normalize by the sample size.

112
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:47.859
Zeljko Ivezic: And another point I forgot to emphasize. So as you move this boundary when we talked about contamination

113
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.840
Zeljko Ivezic: and completeness.

114
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:55.039
Zeljko Ivezic: So you place this boundary that will give you certain value

115
00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:03.459
Zeljko Ivezic: of completeness and contamination. But you can say, Well, I don't really care about completeness.

116
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:17.050
Zeljko Ivezic: I really care about contamination. If I make statements that some object on sky is safe galaxy, I want to be fairly confident that this is a galaxy, and I don't care if I miss

117
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:24.280
Zeljko Ivezic: 90% of galaxies, but dead one, that the whole galaxy and that will spend the night of expensive telescope looking at it.

118
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:29.640
Zeljko Ivezic: I want to be nearly certain. That means that you want to move this boundary to the right

119
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:39.080
Zeljko Ivezic: as you go to the right. your contamination drops down, because this tail goes to 0, but your completeness also goes down.

120
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:52.620
Zeljko Ivezic: But in some cases you don't care. In some other cases like, for example, when, as the assess was looking for quasars. And what did they want to complete sample? The first step is to select candidate from images.

121
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.489
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you go get spectrum and prove that it's a phrase there.

122
00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:08.009
Zeljko Ivezic: And if you if it's not a quasar, then you just say, Well, it's not a Quasar, but you want to end up with as complete sample as possible. In that case you would move this boundary to the left.

123
00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:17.450
Zeljko Ivezic: and you would be accepting more and more contamination from this part. but you would move to the left until you would be certain that you are

124
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:43.220
Zeljko Ivezic: on the left side of the source distribution. So where exactly you want to place that boundary depends on your particular application, and so you can't have both. You can't have high completeness and low contamination. It's a trade-off and then practice support one versus the other. It's called Roc, correct receiver operating characteristic term. And we'll we'll do that week from now.

125
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.080
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay, so back to clustering.

126
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:54.029
Zeljko Ivezic: Let's start with the most popular and maybe the oldest clustering method called pay means.

127
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.369
Zeljko Ivezic: So with this formula.

128
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.390
Zeljko Ivezic: So first, what is the cluster by. When we say cluster, we imply that we have a bunch of points

129
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.420
Zeljko Ivezic: points in a given cluster

130
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:19.339
Zeljko Ivezic: that are much closer to each other than any other points in the distribution that we have. So basically, then you go and you measure distance between any 2 points.

131
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:33.870
Zeljko Ivezic: And so this formula simply says, this X. I'm just new. K. Says Xi. Position. Of course, Xi is position of a given point in your sample.

132
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.389
Zeljko Ivezic: Mu K is the center of some cluster.

133
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.399
Zeljko Ivezic: We'll see how we get to clusters.

134
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:47.760
Zeljko Ivezic: So Uk is the center of that cluster, and then they sum these businesses, for here squares with distances

135
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:59.250
Zeljko Ivezic: over a given cluster. That's I. Down into CKI. Down into cluster number K, and then it sign it over all the clusters, so each point will be assigned

136
00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:04.270
Zeljko Ivezic: a cluster label, and then we just count this distances.

137
00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:20.570
Zeljko Ivezic: So if I need classified 8 points, and I put it in one cluster, which is far away. Then immediately the distance will go up and go. So if I have optimal cluster separation, then this sum will be minimum.

138
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:26.780
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's how we find pastors we start by. There is example of data

139
00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:34.270
Zeljko Ivezic: here. It's not the best image of all. But you can see some. You can see some data points.

140
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:41.609
Zeljko Ivezic: And then you can see how it progresses from left to right. It's Internet process.

141
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.470
Zeljko Ivezic: So at the beginning we choose number of clusters.

142
00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.539
Zeljko Ivezic: Again, we can go through a grid of the number of clusters we don't know

143
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.010
Zeljko Ivezic: pre-ordered.

144
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.240
Zeljko Ivezic: So we'll try 2 plastic 3 plasters. Okay.

145
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.830
Zeljko Ivezic: if we have optimal separation, that distance management would be minimized.

146
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:06.940
Zeljko Ivezic: And then, if you say how many we have here, that was case with 3, I believe I see, big points are the centers.

147
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:14.660
Zeljko Ivezic: So here we are trying 3 clusters. And so they ran the League. We randomly put in

148
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:24.649
Zeljko Ivezic: the 3 cluster centers that's shown here, and then for each of these centers, you calculate distance.

149
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.790
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you

150
00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.839
Zeljko Ivezic: basically offset by little bit this

151
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:51.390
Zeljko Ivezic: positions and that different ways of doing it with gradient or random, etcetera. And then you recalculate distance, and so, little by little, you move the centers until they move into the center of the clusters. And so now, at the end. Actually, there were 4 of these. So there are 4 clusters, these red one

152
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:58.729
Zeljko Ivezic: and the green one, and this 2 that was split into with the red one, you can see that there is structure

153
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:05.120
Zeljko Ivezic: that indicates that you need another cluster. So now, if you did, computation file clusters.

154
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.700
Zeljko Ivezic: then these 3 up

155
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:27.480
Zeljko Ivezic: in the last panel on top would remain unchanged, but the red cluster in the bottom left would get split into 2, and then distances. Some often over, is, walk out to concentrations would be smaller the sum of distances than this block. And that's how we will conclude that there are 5 clusters.

156
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:39.829
Zeljko Ivezic: So the next should be example of that. Okay, so this code I basically copied from psychiclearn. That's their example of K-means.

157
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.609
Zeljko Ivezic: You also have example in ask right now.

158
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:47.609
Zeljko Ivezic: But since I could learn, and in particular this sample is famous.

159
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.999
Zeljko Ivezic: These are some flowers.

160
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.190
Zeljko Ivezic: and they have some measured properties like

161
00:19:55.250 --> 00:20:01.680
Zeljko Ivezic: battle with and cetera. And then this sample.

162
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:16.900
Zeljko Ivezic: I guess it was constructed maybe 50, 40 years ago. Every new method takes the sample to demonstrate how they can do it. It's not very large sample. But they had beautiful visualization. So I added it here. And that's basically their code

163
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:18.920
Zeljko Ivezic: imported from

164
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.740
Zeljko Ivezic: psychic learn page.

165
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:28.760
Zeljko Ivezic: So the key line is these 2. So basically, you just

166
00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.100
Zeljko Ivezic: import from

167
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:32.659
Zeljko Ivezic: psychic learn.

168
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:38.639
Zeljko Ivezic: you import this data set with the flowers. And then you import method called K-means.

169
00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.400
Zeljko Ivezic: It's Iris dataset. I can't remember the the name Iris

170
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:49.390
Zeljko Ivezic: and the the call is

171
00:20:54.470 --> 00:21:04.580
Zeljko Ivezic: here. So you basically give it data set. This S comes from here. So it's a, it's an array of different number of clusters.

172
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:16.639
Zeljko Ivezic: And so then, the call is as simple as that. All that optimization that I was telling you about. It's all done under the food with this one line, and then you end up with your clusters.

173
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:27.810
Zeljko Ivezic: So when we minimize this distance, there is one implicit assumption that needs to be stated when we say that these distances have to be minimized.

174
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:34.379
Zeljko Ivezic: This is equivalent to saying that we assume all these clusters are spherical

175
00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.420
Zeljko Ivezic: and homogeneous.

176
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:55.390
Zeljko Ivezic: So you imagine sphere uniformly populated with point process and another sphere and another sphere. If this is true for your sample, then K-means is as good as any other method. You can't beat it because you simply minimize these distances, and that's the correct assumption.

177
00:21:55.530 --> 00:22:00.049
Zeljko Ivezic: If your clusters are not spherical or not homogeneous.

178
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.720
Zeljko Ivezic: then K. Means is not optimal.

179
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:17.530
Zeljko Ivezic: Maybe it will work fine, depending on your data set, but there is no guarantee that it's optimal, and indeed you can have better methods to find clusters like. Imagine that your clusters instead of spheres, are very elongated.

180
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.960
Zeljko Ivezic: Like Zucchinis.

181
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:35.709
Zeljko Ivezic: You would model this with a Gaussian distribution that has very elongated principal axes, and then very tiny other axes. In this case, so very elongated distributions. Gaussian mixture model would beat K-means by a large factor.

182
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:43.999
Zeljko Ivezic: So it all depends on what kind of samples you have. The other example here, and the one that we already discussed

183
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:50.670
Zeljko Ivezic: in the left panel. That's exactly the same sample that they started with those measurements of mentalicity

184
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.770
Zeljko Ivezic: and Alpha were Fd. For stars.

185
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:59.050
Zeljko Ivezic: You can see here the 4 centers that painting is found

186
00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.939
Zeljko Ivezic: and the boundaries between clusters.

187
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:11.019
Zeljko Ivezic: And obviously this is not a very good description of what you see, and the reason is exactly that these distributions are rather elevated.

188
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:16.959
Zeljko Ivezic: The other example is here in the big 3 big panels.

189
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:21.300
Zeljko Ivezic: So we have 3 clusters and some background noise.

190
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.760
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now, when you run pay means.

191
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:29.160
Zeljko Ivezic: because these are not uniform spherical distributions.

192
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:36.330
Zeljko Ivezic: these parts in the middle panel, these blue points, and these green points. They were attached to wrong cluster.

193
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:53.150
Zeljko Ivezic: and finally, Em, that stands for expectation maximization. That's the same thing as Gaussian mixture model, because these clusters with drone from Gaussian. So you can see how density of the red cluster falls towards the edge. So here, because

194
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.160
Zeljko Ivezic: you have Gaussians as your basic model, then you get

195
00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:04.039
Zeljko Ivezic: optimal. Without you can recognize all 3. So again, it all depends on your sample.

196
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:09.330
Zeljko Ivezic: and in applications you always have to visualize it

197
00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.300
Zeljko Ivezic: and think about whether it makes sense or not.

198
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:19.150
Zeljko Ivezic: So none of these methods can think for you. They can save you tedious work.

199
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:30.930
Zeljko Ivezic: especially when you have huge samples and you have 5 move to dimensional cases. They can help you with their proposals. For what is the structure in data?

200
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:44.779
Zeljko Ivezic: But they can never think for you. You have to think about if it makes sense in your particular case, where you may have some prior information. You have some expectations. You have to convince yourself that you got the right things.

201
00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.350
Zeljko Ivezic: and so it's nicely illustrated

202
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:53.250
Zeljko Ivezic: in this diagram. So this one comes also from psychic learning.

203
00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.180
Zeljko Ivezic: So we only talked so far about

204
00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.609
Zeljko Ivezic: K-means and Gaussian mixture model.

205
00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:10.939
Zeljko Ivezic: But here they are, 3, 6, 11 methods, 3, 6, 11 methods that you can get from site to learn. So each phone is a different clustering method.

206
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.830
Zeljko Ivezic: And then that 6 rows and the 6 rows show you

207
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.670
Zeljko Ivezic: the data distribution.

208
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:24.169
Zeljko Ivezic: So we had some clusters like we just looked at it. Now in the penalty. We throw that 3

209
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:37.690
Zeljko Ivezic: blobs. The last one is uniform distribution in a square, just to show what each method would produce in this nonsense case. But they're not clusters, just uniform distribution.

210
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:48.819
Zeljko Ivezic: Then you have very distributions in this row. and then the tool on top are particularly hard, because the structure is enclosed

211
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:55.430
Zeljko Ivezic: within another structure in the top. and then the second row is similar idea, but

212
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.730
Zeljko Ivezic: slightly different morphology.

213
00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:06.530
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now each method will do well in some cases, but not in all the cases. So

214
00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:16.549
Zeljko Ivezic: K. Means that's well here in the in this row. I don't know if people in Zoom can see I'm looking at the fifth row.

215
00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:27.269
Zeljko Ivezic: In this example, K-means works fine because data distribution is consistent with the implicit assumption. Okay, means that you have roughly.

216
00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:38.310
Zeljko Ivezic: as soon as you make them elevated K-means folks apart, and these 2 clusters in the fourth row in the first panel are Miss classified.

217
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:49.640
Zeljko Ivezic: and then the first 2 rows. Of course. Kvs. that's very poorly, because the morphology of data distribution is very different than very complex.

218
00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:56.649
Zeljko Ivezic: On the other hand, they have methods like, if you look at the end Gaussian mixture.

219
00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:10.869
Zeljko Ivezic: it will, of course, easily do the fifth row. But Gaussian mixture model also does well in the fourth row. So because these elongated distributions are easily modeled as guys.

220
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:24.270
Zeljko Ivezic: However, the top row. If you look at the top right panel, Gaussian mixture for those 2 circles. it doesn't work that morphology because it it's part of describing the.

221
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:33.939
Zeljko Ivezic: But they are some methods like, if you look at the 3, 6, 7 and 9 phone dB, scan and optics algorithms.

222
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:38.050
Zeljko Ivezic: They actually do quite well even with these complicated pathologies.

223
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.599
Zeljko Ivezic: So we will say a little bit more about

224
00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:53.500
Zeljko Ivezic: dB, scan and optics at the end of the lifetime, and we will be moving now to our method. That is similar to the 6 phone clustering

225
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:59.210
Zeljko Ivezic: where you go bottom up and you try to connect objects.

226
00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:07.109
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you put some limits on the maximum amount of distance between objects. And that's how, then you separate clusters.

227
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:19.450
Zeljko Ivezic: So in theory it should work in the fifth row, too. But probably that particular example wasn't optimized, and they put a cut that was too large. But it should work well with this case, too.

228
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.169
Zeljko Ivezic: and we'll build.

229
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:31.130
Zeljko Ivezic: See a particular example in a moment. So the bottom line of this image is that there are many methods out there.

230
00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:37.560
Zeljko Ivezic: The performance of any method depends on the morphology of your data distribution.

231
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.409
Zeljko Ivezic: So there is no magic recipe

232
00:28:40.650 --> 00:29:00.040
Zeljko Ivezic: like. If you do this, you must take this method, etc. You have to first do so-called data exploration of your data set. You have to plot your data. You have to trust the values you have, you have to understand. It's scattered. You have to understand. If you have outliers.

233
00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:16.790
Zeljko Ivezic: you have to have at least a rough idea of the morphology of your clusters, etcetera, and then you always try to at least 4, 3 different methods. When I do real research or publication site, always try at least 3 methods.

234
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:30.520
Zeljko Ivezic: and I try to make them agree, or I don't trust my results, especially if the sample is not very large, or if the sample is highly multi-dimensional. And sometimes you, you can have 30, 40

235
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:48.450
Zeljko Ivezic: numbers that are measured for your data point. It's like 20 dimensional space. It's very hard to visualize it. And so, as a scientist, you have to be very conservative and not jump up and down at the first sign of success of some discovery, but you have to look at it

236
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:58.240
Zeljko Ivezic: with a grain of salt, and ask yourself, can I reproduce this in different ways, or is it just a fluke of particular methods. So that's the the main message.

237
00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.430
Zeljko Ivezic: So we'll go now

238
00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:14.309
Zeljko Ivezic: to a particular real example, and we'll compare 2 methods, Gaussian mixture models that we introduced last time. So we will not go again through it. But we will apply it.

239
00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:26.840
Zeljko Ivezic: And then we'll apply a very different algorithm algorithm that does not model. but rather just looks at the positions of points.

240
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:32.249
Zeljko Ivezic: and then based on their distance distribution as science clusters.

241
00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.589
Zeljko Ivezic: And so how will you define distance.

242
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:41.270
Zeljko Ivezic: If you have a sample of of points in multi-dimensional space.

243
00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:45.610
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you have 2 clusters, that's the first line.

244
00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.900
Zeljko Ivezic: you have 2 clusters.

245
00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:58.389
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you are asking, what is the minimum distance between any pair points where 1 point is from one cluster, the other one is from the other.

246
00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:01.780
Zeljko Ivezic: And so if you started with more clusters.

247
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:06.890
Zeljko Ivezic: then you would in the first step you calculate distances

248
00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:09.670
Zeljko Ivezic: between all the points.

249
00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:17.500
Zeljko Ivezic: So it's a large matrix, and then you take those that have the smallest for each source. You take the smallest distance.

250
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.279
Zeljko Ivezic: and you sign up here. So web is

251
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:36.379
Zeljko Ivezic: the closest, for you disappear. So if you were doing now and then there is some pressure. So let's say, here, you want to cluster you, and we say you have to be the closest neighbor, and the distance has to be less than one meter.

252
00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:38.740
Zeljko Ivezic: so I won't experience it.

253
00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:54.939
Zeljko Ivezic: He doesn't have anyone within one meter, so he stays faster, and you 2 are very close to each other. You are each to each each of you, with the other. One is the nearest network, and you are closer than one meeting, so you become a failure.

254
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:58.960
Zeljko Ivezic: And then I look at that 3 of you there, very close.

255
00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:06.359
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now.

256
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:10.219
Zeljko Ivezic: But now you have these 2 neighbors, and you take him as your.

257
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:17.680
Zeljko Ivezic: and so you, too, would be a fair if it's less than one meter. And so I go through this one step.

258
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:28.390
Zeljko Ivezic: and now I can see the pairs of points and do the same with the pairs, and then I connect them into larger and larger units, and you'll see in a moment how it works in practice.

259
00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:37.569
Zeljko Ivezic: then we can also define average distance and distance between cluster centers, etc. And so here is our example.

260
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:50.669
Zeljko Ivezic: So the top panel is what we already discussed. These are those, as these says, galaxies in 3 dimensional space and slice through the third point.

261
00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:58.319
Zeljko Ivezic: So you can see this group of galaxies by eye in the center called as the assess great wall of galaxies.

262
00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.319
Zeljko Ivezic: So now you run this algorithm

263
00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.789
Zeljko Ivezic: and you can see these little lines that connect the points.

264
00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:19.360
Zeljko Ivezic: So in the first iterative step it was pairs, and then you look at the next one, and at the end everybody's connected to someone, either as a single point or a fair or more complicated geometry.

265
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:29.249
Zeljko Ivezic: So after this fed, then, we define clusters by cutting out all the connections.

266
00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:34.180
Zeljko Ivezic: They are above some limit. like we've had one meter here.

267
00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:44.189
Zeljko Ivezic: So we have these connections. So what remains are only those points that are very close to each other, and they're connected to their nearest neighbors.

268
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.159
Zeljko Ivezic: And so once we cross

269
00:33:46.310 --> 00:34:03.169
Zeljko Ivezic: once we cut these lines, for example, we now have an isolated cluster in here that has maybe 10 or so galaxies in it. Some other clusters are much larger. And so now the question is, how do we define? How do you determine the threshold for your clusters?

270
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:16.669
Zeljko Ivezic: And it's more art and science. So it depends on the particular case. And here, too. I would calculate distances between the points just like the metric for K means.

271
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:24.919
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you could calculate that distance, that metric as a function of threshold in the length of the connection.

272
00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:34.320
Zeljko Ivezic: and then, as you would be going down this threshold, you would start to rate and roughly. But that need happens is what people usually do in practice.

273
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:42.840
Zeljko Ivezic: Actually, now that they think about it, such a plot in the lecture would have been great. and this bottom panel is often called the endocrine.

274
00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.960
Zeljko Ivezic: and the method is called hierarchical clustering.

275
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:53.290
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now we'll apply it to another data set. And compared to Gaussian mixture model.

276
00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:55.860
Zeljko Ivezic: So this pretty.

277
00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:03.639
Zeljko Ivezic: this pretty picture is real data.

278
00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:07.720
Zeljko Ivezic: It shows asteroids. and

279
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:27.750
Zeljko Ivezic: the 3 columns correspond to 3 regions after they developed between Mars and Jupiter. and their separation is defined, so called.

280
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:39.229
Zeljko Ivezic: and so in each panel we have 2 coordinates. So XX is semi major.

281
00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:48.640
Zeljko Ivezic: and the Y-axis is the sign of 40,000. Approximately, it's the coordinate out of the faster result.

282
00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:55.980
Zeljko Ivezic: And so each point is one asteroid. There are about 50,000 of them.

283
00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:23.100
Zeljko Ivezic: and the colors are based on, so they are not exactly the colors, but they are equivalent colors of the rocks like we have marble that is white, or we can have pink marble, we have black, and so on. So this basic is analogous to rocks where different colors

284
00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.170
Zeljko Ivezic: comes from the way it reflects sunlight.

285
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:36.390
Zeljko Ivezic: And the reason we see us that this is also reflection of sunlight and the rocky bodies that have different chemical compositions on the surface. That's why they have this different cost.

286
00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:45.629
Zeljko Ivezic: And so here we have very strongly defined clusters, and you can see that with your eyes because of these.

287
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:53.769
Zeljko Ivezic: and it is believed that each of these clusters used to be much larger aspect that was destroyed in collision and other us.

288
00:36:54.020 --> 00:37:15.469
Zeljko Ivezic: And now all these small pieces are still moved in one bit of space together because of energy implemented sufficient in space. They are. They diffuse through face space. So they they are all around because they are not plump in real genetic space. But in the space reported about ambulance you can still see this puzzle.

289
00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:25.600
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now the problem that that was one of my undergrad students who solved it. The problem was to take these clusters in the top row

290
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:32.070
Zeljko Ivezic: and then numerically identify them. and then find

291
00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:38.819
Zeljko Ivezic: everything that is in clusters. Take it out of the sample, and then look at the background.

292
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:49.879
Zeljko Ivezic: Because now background would give you a better idea of if there is any chemical gradient in the solar system, as predicted by theory of cognition.

293
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:57.909
Zeljko Ivezic: When you look at all the asterisk, then you are heavily biased by the number of these small pieces that came out.

294
00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:05.160
Zeljko Ivezic: That's not what you want. What you want is just playground. And then see, that is really that was the the science of it.

295
00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:08.450
Zeljko Ivezic: But before we had Sdss. Scholars.

296
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:14.090
Zeljko Ivezic: this is what people would do. So this is the same data set.

297
00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:20.379
Zeljko Ivezic: These are the same 3 panels as in the top row of this image.

298
00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:25.869
Zeljko Ivezic: but it's black and white because colors are not used, and that's how people

299
00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:30.019
Zeljko Ivezic: studied after it's private to Sdss and modern weight.

300
00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:42.900
Zeljko Ivezic: So again, XX. Is all the 12 elements and sign inclination. You can tell by your eye that the distribution of these points is not homogeneous that that clusters.

301
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:49.670
Zeljko Ivezic: And so we want now to find these clusters. And the science is based, then, on the number of clusters.

302
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.900
Zeljko Ivezic: on

303
00:38:51.000 --> 00:39:12.840
Zeljko Ivezic: number objects per cluster the size, distribution of these objects, etc., etc. There are many theories, for how collisions happen, but for all of that the first step is to get the clusters defined for each object? Is it in a cluster, or is it kind of associated? And then you can do the rest of specific science analysis.

304
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:23.929
Zeljko Ivezic: So we will now apply what we learned last time, Gaussian mixture model, where we will say that each cluster can be modeled as Gaussian distribution in this space

305
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:38.370
Zeljko Ivezic: in practice. Actually, there is another orbit. But for the sake of this class you're just doing too deep. So we have Gaussian mixture model, and we don't know how many clusters we have.

306
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:42.279
Zeljko Ivezic: So it says somewhere, I think it's 59,

307
00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:51.860
Zeljko Ivezic: right? So we will try anything up to 59, as we learned last time, we will compute BIC, and choose the best fit.

308
00:39:53.320 --> 00:40:00.329
Zeljko Ivezic: And so these little piece of code. This is all what you need for Gaussian picture model clustering.

309
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:04.139
Zeljko Ivezic: This GMM. Comes from.

310
00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:10.480
Zeljko Ivezic: I think. Psychit learn, I have to remind myself. Is it psychit? Learn, or is it Astro. Ml.

311
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:34.650
Zeljko Ivezic: where is it now? It's from Psyche to learn. Gmm. Also another thing that often happens that shouldn't discourage you. Many of these methods are still being developed, or people find a better way to do it, and so on. So sometimes you go to psychic learn.

312
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:38.250
Zeljko Ivezic: and you have a piece of code that is supposed to work

313
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:44.979
Zeljko Ivezic: like you took some example from these lectures, and then you go to Psyche, learn, and then you run it, and then it breaks.

314
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:48.080
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you are frustrated.

315
00:40:49.090 --> 00:41:00.899
Zeljko Ivezic: But you shouldn't give up, because that happens very often, because they change some little thing in Api in the way you pull the method. They change the name of some keyword.

316
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:22.070
Zeljko Ivezic: and it's enough to have one character change somewhere to break the code, so do not give up immediately. If it doesn't work, it's not you. It happens often to all of us. And indeed this lecture didn't work. Few days ago I had actually go and fix things, because in GM. From psychic learn they change some keywords. And then it broke everything.

317
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:37.629
Zeljko Ivezic: But now it it now it's working. So what do we do. That's the alright. So here there is this major client from Aster, Ml, where you get the clean data set. Of course, with your data set.

318
00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:46.890
Zeljko Ivezic: you have your data exploration step where you have to convince yourself that you understand, outliers the error, distribution, etc.

319
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:56.559
Zeljko Ivezic: And so there are colors here, and 3 orbital elements. And for pedagogical reasons, we just do 2 elements.

320
00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:01.990
Zeljko Ivezic: We stack those 2 vectors. And that's what we sent to GM, the capital X.

321
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:07.590
Zeljko Ivezic: And so basically. that's what we're doing here. This N

322
00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.739
Zeljko Ivezic: is array of the number of clusters. So one to 59.

323
00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:17.420
Zeljko Ivezic: And then calculation of this best

324
00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:24.350
Zeljko Ivezic: fit multiple Gaussian sum and their parameters. It's as simple as this single line.

325
00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:30.809
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you also get computation of Bic. And so

326
00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.669
Zeljko Ivezic: then, where is it? Now? Then, we plot. BIC,

327
00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:41.370
Zeljko Ivezic: so y axis is BIC, and the X axis is

328
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:52.950
Zeljko Ivezic: the number of components. I added Aic for completeness, because that's what most computer scientists are used to. But again, Bic is the

329
00:42:53.900 --> 00:43:00.970
Zeljko Ivezic: BIC is more statistically sound metric. And so it goes down because you

330
00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:05.550
Zeljko Ivezic: have a better and better and better fit, and then it levels.

331
00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:18.489
Zeljko Ivezic: So now all these ranges, 30, 40, 50, 60, they all would have similar success in describing distribution, but because the more Gaussians you add to the sum.

332
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:23.890
Zeljko Ivezic: the more model parameters you have, and the more you get penalized

333
00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:33.649
Zeljko Ivezic: for the model complexity. When you compute BI see this dotted line is slightly going up. There is actually local minimum at 42 here.

334
00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:36.879
Zeljko Ivezic: But any of these numbers would be

335
00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:55.049
Zeljko Ivezic: equally good. If I calculated this to say 100 or 200, then the dotted line would definitely start going up more significantly. The fact that it's so planned tells us that we can't really distinguish cases from 30 plus clusters up to 60 or so. They are all

336
00:43:55.130 --> 00:44:08.459
Zeljko Ivezic: statistically, equally justified. And that's what we get so let me just remind myself, the blue ellipses have limits on the number of objects or no, they are the most

337
00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:13.020
Zeljko Ivezic: so that's the result. There are 42 abuses.

338
00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.319
Zeljko Ivezic: each one signaling. One signifies the cluster.

339
00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.910
Zeljko Ivezic: So it's basically one seat my lips.

340
00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:28.160
Zeljko Ivezic: Now, when you would want to classify these points, therefore, each point you would ask.

341
00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:30.539
Zeljko Ivezic: what is the probability

342
00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:41.050
Zeljko Ivezic: given what each of these 4 people clusters, and the one that gives you the highest probability would be your cluster, and then you can also put the threshold

343
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:48.320
Zeljko Ivezic: and say, if that probability is not about some threshold, then your orphan don't belong to any faster.

344
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.250
Zeljko Ivezic: So, for example, if you look at

345
00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.470
Zeljko Ivezic: if you look and say

346
00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:04.369
Zeljko Ivezic: third panel on the right, the top left ellipse.

347
00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:09.970
Zeljko Ivezic: They are some objects that are very flustered. and

348
00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:14.469
Zeljko Ivezic: they are fairly close to that ellipse. So in this case

349
00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:20.979
Zeljko Ivezic: you would say, you belong to this cluster. But here the problem is, there are also some other objects

350
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:26.390
Zeljko Ivezic: that will be assigned to this cluster and to your eye it looks like they are

351
00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:37.129
Zeljko Ivezic: different from the little cluster, but they are close to the center of the building. So this is one example where we are not super happy with with the way it was clustered in. Gauss.

352
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:39.760
Zeljko Ivezic: On the other hand, if you look at

353
00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:49.279
Zeljko Ivezic: if this one in the left panel bottom right, they are. 2 Gaussians got 2 clusters that are close to each other.

354
00:45:49.480 --> 00:46:16.310
Zeljko Ivezic: but to the eye it looks like it's probably one faster. So again, you would now want to zoom in. To look at this structure. To ask yourself, is the morphology really like one elevated, smooth distribution or the behavior like some local minimum? And it really looks like 2 faster. So you don't just take it at face failure. You have to play with it and compute various metrics to convince yourself

355
00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:37.040
Zeljko Ivezic: that the distribution is correct with with asteroids. When you look in detail, you learn that actually, it's not. Gauss is a multiple description. There are some dynamical effects that cause asteroids to diffuse little, not across space. And so then there are very thick tails

356
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:40.329
Zeljko Ivezic: that are inconsistent with Gaussian distribution.

357
00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.440
Zeljko Ivezic: And that's why this doesn't look very impressive in this example.

358
00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:50.269
Zeljko Ivezic: If I generated bunch of clusters from Gaussian distribution. Then it would look perfect.

359
00:46:51.210 --> 00:47:04.129
Zeljko Ivezic: But then we wouldn't learn this lesson that you should never trust any method. But compare multiple methods. Now let's see what this other method would do on the same data set.

360
00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:15.629
Zeljko Ivezic: So let me scroll down. So for comparison. the same 42 Gaussians are illustrated in the top panel.

361
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.440
Zeljko Ivezic: I didn't emphasize. But these ellipses

362
00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:35.170
Zeljko Ivezic: it doesn't mean that if a point is inside the list that it belongs to that ellipse. And if it's outside of the elixir, doesn't these just visualize these Gaussians? But those probability distributions are Gaussian.

363
00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:54.140
Zeljko Ivezic: So as you go further away from the center of the ellipse there is decreasing probability you belong to, but you actually have to compute from the parameters of this Gaussian for each point which lips gives you the highest probability. In other words, for each Gaussian, you have to ask

364
00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:59.469
Zeljko Ivezic: how how far I am from the center in terms of 6 months.

365
00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:04.670
Zeljko Ivezic: not in green space, but in terms of Sigmas. How far am I different from details?

366
00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.329
Zeljko Ivezic: So the result

367
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:13.369
Zeljko Ivezic: in the top panel is the results. In the 2 other panels are

368
00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:22.119
Zeljko Ivezic: this hierarchical clustering model. So the middle panel shows the result of associating each data point

369
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.290
Zeljko Ivezic: into a structure.

370
00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.289
Zeljko Ivezic: And then we say.

371
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:31.439
Zeljko Ivezic: if you have neighbors.

372
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:42.050
Zeljko Ivezic: they are closer than some threshold, then you belong to a cluster, and if your connection is larger, then you are more fun.

373
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:47.320
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now you can see in the bottom panel the results of these clusters.

374
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:56.050
Zeljko Ivezic: So with there are many objects in the background that are not associated. Sometimes you have very large clusters.

375
00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:13.639
Zeljko Ivezic: There are boundaries in between that are not visible in this visualization, but for each of these clusters like this one is nicely separated. Now you can see the one in the bottom right panel in the top left. This one came out nicely, as you would expect, based on visual inspection.

376
00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:18.460
Zeljko Ivezic: There is bunch of points, and and they are associate. Okay.

377
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:30.539
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's example of how you can do better job with this hierarchical method. Then with Gaussians. If your data distribution is strongly non Gaussian.

378
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:44.009
Zeljko Ivezic: and then with this particular example, then you can now color the dots with colors that I showed you in the first plot and ask yourself, Are they all uniform in color or not? Etcetera?

379
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:59.180
Zeljko Ivezic: Alright. And so now we'll also, just for fun. Apply our density, estimation methods that we used

380
00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.819
Zeljko Ivezic: last time on the same data set.

381
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:08.289
Zeljko Ivezic: and I tried hard to transpose this image, but I failed. I don't know why.

382
00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:10.500
Zeljko Ivezic: was late last night.

383
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:28.199
Zeljko Ivezic: and what this shows is exactly the same diagram, but rotated by 90 degrees. And this is essentially 2 dimensional histogram. It's not histogram, because it was computed with the kernel density estimator. So there is this integral over pixels, but

384
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:34.239
Zeljko Ivezic: the blue is low, count, the green is higher, count, and the red is the highest count.

385
00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:44.530
Zeljko Ivezic: And now you can see clearly these clusters. So if I had now to go and publish any of these results from the previous methods.

386
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:59.669
Zeljko Ivezic: I would certainly carefully compare those results with this just, plain, essentially count of objects, and try to convince myself that there are no spurious clusters so that I'm not missing any significant clusters.

387
00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:13.020
Zeljko Ivezic: You may ask, well, why do I bother? Why would I bother with other methods? Then I can simply go to this diagram. and I can simply circle all the high density regions.

388
00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:21.279
Zeljko Ivezic: And that would be good question. And indeed, you could do that. One problem in practice would be that these different clusters have

389
00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:41.649
Zeljko Ivezic: vastly different counts of asterisk, so like the largest one, the one that has little bit of red in the center is many thousands of asterisk in that one cluster, while some other clusters they have only few tenths of asterisk, and so your selection function would be highly dependent on the size of the cluster.

390
00:51:42.040 --> 00:52:05.270
Zeljko Ivezic: while if those clusters where Gaussian in reality, then Gaussian nature model would give you fairly uniform selection, function all the way to some parts on limits, but as soon as you would have 10 or 20 asterisks you could fit Gaussian components with no problem, so there is always trade off in practice, and you have to think about your data.

391
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:19.429
Zeljko Ivezic: And then we also talked about talked about 2 modern methods. I think they are not older than 1020 years. Something like that

392
00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:26.629
Zeljko Ivezic: one is called dB. Scan, which stands for density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise.

393
00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:34.690
Zeljko Ivezic: So it's a very long title. I think that we're trying to get dB scan acronym. And it basically

394
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:40.660
Zeljko Ivezic: says. when we do clustering. what we mean by cluster is

395
00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:52.329
Zeljko Ivezic: that there are many points that are much closer to each other than to any other points in that space. So exactly the same logic as K means. But the implementation is different.

396
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:54.170
Zeljko Ivezic: and

397
00:52:54.660 --> 00:53:08.569
Zeljko Ivezic: optics is slightly more involved, but follows the same idea, and there is an excellent article at this link that will explain in detail how it works. If you are interested.

398
00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:15.410
Zeljko Ivezic: Interestingly, this is a colleague from Sarajevo, a young woman who is specializing in data mining in Sarajevo.

399
00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:28.750
Zeljko Ivezic: And now here this piece of code was also copied directly from psychiclearn. and it shows this nice example of

400
00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:42.140
Zeljko Ivezic: optics and Dv. Scan. And so here, too, with Dv. Scan. There are 2 free parameters you need to optimize. And with optics, I think there are 2 additional ones.

401
00:53:42.160 --> 00:54:00.459
Zeljko Ivezic: and so on the same sample. You can now see how they perform. It's little bit misleading, because optics in such case should be better than dB scan, and in the right panel bottom, right panel. You can see the dB scan did quite a good job.

402
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:18.689
Zeljko Ivezic: and optics doesn't seem to be as good that some other is classified points. But probably it wasn't optimized in this particular piece of code, but this gives you a template for how to apply these methods for particular data set. So if you had to do

403
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:22.209
Zeljko Ivezic: of some real data set. I would certainly try these 2 methods

404
00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:50.030
Zeljko Ivezic: so and see what they get if they give you. If at least 3, 4 of them give you consistent results, then you are in good shape.

405
00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:56.589
Zeljko Ivezic: If each method gives you different results. then you should think hard before you publish these results.

406
00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:04.299
Zeljko Ivezic: And this example was so we talked about.

407
00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:10.910
Zeljko Ivezic: we talked about this example. So it's a nice companion of 11 different methods.

408
00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:20.330
Zeljko Ivezic: And it's applied to 6 different data sets. So if you wanted to play with particular data set that you have maybe to earn a box of chocolates.

409
00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:29.580
Zeljko Ivezic: then the code that produced this figure is here. So all what you need to do is to read this code step by step.

410
00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:43.159
Zeljko Ivezic: find out how they import the data. You replace that part where they import the data with your data set, and then later, you can execute this code and then see how much it works, etcetera.

411
00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:53.219
Zeljko Ivezic: if you look carefully. they are 10 columns in this figure. and there were 11 in the first figure I showed you.

412
00:55:53.240 --> 00:56:01.149
Zeljko Ivezic: and the reason is that I stole the first figure from psychic learn site. And this one I actually produced by running this code.

413
00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:08.089
Zeljko Ivezic: And there was one method between dB scan and optics. I forget what it was called that I could not make to work.

414
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:16.030
Zeljko Ivezic: That was that example of changes in Api, and for some reason it just wouldn't work, and I didn't figure it out. So I just

415
00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:18.380
Zeljko Ivezic: removed it. And now it works.

416
00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:28.260
Zeljko Ivezic: So I think that was the material for today. So I'll stop here. And then.

417
00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.290
Zeljko Ivezic: if you have questions, let's discuss it.

418
00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:35.720
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay.

419
00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:39.090
Zeljko Ivezic: so

420
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:46.410
thanks.

421
00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:06.379
Zeljko Ivezic: it's an excellent. So how I deny people on something here. How

422
00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:17.319
Zeljko Ivezic: do we convince ourselves that we have true clusters. If we have highly, multi dimensional case. and you cannot easily visualize it like we can into the.

423
00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:29.119
Zeljko Ivezic: So again, when we say clusters mathematically, it means that we had subsets of our data points that are closer to each other than to the rest of the points.

424
00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:39.149
Zeljko Ivezic: So then, whatever the method is, you can always compute that metric that we started with, so the most fundamental metric for clustering is.

425
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:48.710
Zeljko Ivezic: let me go back to it phase one. So this metric can be computed for the results of any event.

426
00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:55.210
Zeljko Ivezic: And so then, in multi-dimensional case, you just generalize it. But there is one.

427
00:57:55.220 --> 00:58:00.839
Zeljko Ivezic: There is one thing one has to be careful about, because when we have how we move to dimensional places.

428
00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:10.949
Zeljko Ivezic: often these coordinates are different physical or other quantities, so like in threed XYZ. Then it's pretty up. It's 3 dimensional space.

429
00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:27.739
Zeljko Ivezic: But if you now go to 6 dimensional space of 3 geometric positions and feed a lot of these, like what you do in in astronomy, often to find clusters of start to Milky Way. Then how do you do it. You can't calculate distance, velocity, and space.

430
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:34.360
Zeljko Ivezic: So in practice, what people do in such cases is to so-called widen the basa.

431
00:58:34.610 --> 00:58:38.120
Zeljko Ivezic: and that basically means for each coordinate

432
00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:48.970
Zeljko Ivezic: you calculate standard deviation. And then the device that coordinates so basically that each coordinate will have standard deviation of one.

433
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:52.899
Zeljko Ivezic: And then these are the dimensionless coordinates

434
00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:55.349
Zeljko Ivezic: that you will be using for cluster.

435
00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:03.709
Zeljko Ivezic: There are other ways to do it. You can also do so-called transformer approach that we have some distribution.

436
00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:09.629
Zeljko Ivezic: or coordinates or distribution of objects in that one coordinate.

437
00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:27.730
Zeljko Ivezic: then you can make cumulative distribution of that that goes from 0 to one, and then you take this cumulative coordinate that is often dimensionless, and for each coordinate for each direction that space it will be the same approach. So then often can get.

438
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:53.890
Zeljko Ivezic: So you get rid of units, and you can also form different distributions going from the original one just without unit to maybe uniform distribution, or what turns out to be appropriate, and then you run different methods. And then you calculate this metric, and you compare whether you really get significant smaller metrics for some methods in the other. You can do cross correlation between methods and ask

439
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:58.459
Zeljko Ivezic: if I have 2 methods to do pairwise comparison.

440
00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:06.670
Zeljko Ivezic: One method. It's labeled in row and the other method gives labels with column, and then the domain. So

441
01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:12.159
Zeljko Ivezic: how many of them agree? So if 2 methods give you identical answer.

442
01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:14.700
Zeljko Ivezic: then you will have the meetings.

443
01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:25.849
Zeljko Ivezic: If there is a lot of mixing, then you have all the diagonal elements, and that's an easy and fast way to assess how consistent. 2 methods are between each other.

444
01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:29.969
Zeljko Ivezic: That's roughly, some of it of what you can bring in practice

445
01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.260
this censorship of philosophy.

446
01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:54.239
Zeljko Ivezic: I think. we will be able to know which philosophy response which portable.

447
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.739
Zeljko Ivezic: So this place.

448
01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:02.409
Zeljko Ivezic: possibly the first velocities, and then, according to the total velocity.

449
01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:05.749
Zeljko Ivezic: to try and find public starving family.

450
01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:11.660
Zeljko Ivezic: Right? So that particular example I had in mind was, we have

451
01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:14.649
Zeljko Ivezic: where we have smooth distribution of start.

452
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:34.870
Zeljko Ivezic: And then in that distribution, smooth distribution, smooth meaning, basically random distribution so many times around the center of the galaxy. If you look at them and don't see any structure with your eyes, it's not like balancing.

453
01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:39.520
Zeljko Ivezic: But then, on top of the background distribution, there are so-called streams

454
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:51.380
Zeljko Ivezic: which are basically remnants of smaller galaxies that they captured by the link debate. Because so because of gravity, it's attracted nearby galaxies.

455
01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:58.309
Zeljko Ivezic: And then because of the gradient in gravitational force because of pilot reports, it's the same thing that causes bike.

456
01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.400
Zeljko Ivezic: So then the galaxy gets strength.

457
01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:08.470
Zeljko Ivezic: and it looks like a stream, like some people call them spaghetti. Zoom spaghetti survey. So these

458
01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:13.100
Zeljko Ivezic: galaxy gets friendship in the tail of the Milky Way.

459
01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:26.490
Zeljko Ivezic: and we want to find it, because when you fit the and how it moves around the center of the galaxy, it's very sensitive to the local organizational potential in panel.

460
01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:31.380
Zeljko Ivezic: And the local authorizational potential we pay about is dominating the darkness.

461
01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:39.070
Zeljko Ivezic: And we know very little about documentary. So that's what industry is currently today to find as many of these team as possible.

462
01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.200
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now, how do I find these screens?

463
01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:47.239
Zeljko Ivezic: The problem is that the number of stars in this tiny balance is spread

464
01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:53.850
Zeljko Ivezic: represents only teeny, tiny increase of local density by 10 to 20.

465
01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:58.430
Zeljko Ivezic: So now you look at some piece of this design you have

466
01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:08.599
Zeljko Ivezic: 1 million stars, but probably maybe 10,000 belongs to screen, and they're also randomly distributed. You can't easily tell which of them belong to the screen.

467
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:20.359
Zeljko Ivezic: So then say, the obvious thing to do would be to basically estimate. And so you have background. And that screen will be on top of the background.

468
01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:31.150
Zeljko Ivezic: And that works if you have a big screen. That's how first things we discovered. We have to see, like with the software spaghetti on your plug. But if you want to be sensitive to the

469
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:39.559
Zeljko Ivezic: smaller screens, then this method becomes less and less efficient. But then you can ask, but in the loss of faith

470
01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:55.050
Zeljko Ivezic: you also have some coherent motion, more or less because of those on the orbit of the of the project for galaxy while the background starts. They have a little orbits around central Galaxy Random.

471
01:03:55.170 --> 01:04:00.500
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you take a control morning and you ask for velocity, distribution,

472
01:04:00.610 --> 01:04:10.350
Zeljko Ivezic: the background starts, they will be essentially.

473
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:21.239
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now in velocity space, you do basically estimate. You would have this Gaussian, and then on the Gaussian, you would see that one direction.

474
01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.580
Zeljko Ivezic: So you need to do both.

475
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:33.259
Zeljko Ivezic: and it's optimal to do it at the same time in one step position and the positive. And so you want to do faster rating, 69 phase

476
01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:52.539
Zeljko Ivezic: or open. It's 5 dimensional because we have proper emotions on the sky. But you don't have radio velocity. And then it comes back to this problem that you have per second and position. But you have to whiten it. And then in that space.

477
01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:57.220
Zeljko Ivezic: Look for over density, and you'll be more efficient than in each separate

478
01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.769
Zeljko Ivezic: space if you don't combine.

479
01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.670
Zeljko Ivezic: That's what we did.

480
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:06.380
Zeljko Ivezic: Good questions.

481
01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:09.730
So the commencement

482
01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:12.089
Zeljko Ivezic: I didn't mention

483
01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:17.879
Zeljko Ivezic: many words might be. So we went through some code

484
01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:23.530
Zeljko Ivezic: the observer

485
01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:31.370
 A

486
01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:44.050
Zeljko Ivezic: what do you mean by value I understood the start of what you said. But then, at the end.

487
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.260
yeah. makes sense

488
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:58.040
delete.

489
01:05:59.370 --> 01:06:06.029
Zeljko Ivezic: But of course, if you're working in the 100 elections. non systematic issues again.

490
01:06:08.550 --> 01:06:11.140
Zeljko Ivezic: then you really able.

491
01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:12.990
Zeljko Ivezic: So digging in

492
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:23.050
you?

493
01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:29.629
Zeljko Ivezic: Right? It's it's very. It's very hard.

494
01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.590
Zeljko Ivezic: There is no recipe universal recipe.

495
01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:49.769
Zeljko Ivezic: So what people usually do is to do. And then you use the rest of it

496
01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:57.469
Zeljko Ivezic: right? That's the standard thing. And it's basically empirical. There is no even just neural networks

497
01:06:57.490 --> 01:07:07.829
Zeljko Ivezic: are hard to understand. Theoretically, basically trying to hear the voice. There are some people who work with theory of neural networks. They can.

498
01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:14.850
Zeljko Ivezic: in a semi hand, saving way, proved universal approximator, and etc., etc.

499
01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:22.769
Zeljko Ivezic: But it's really unknown. Why are they so successful? There is no simple.

500
01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:28.370
Zeljko Ivezic: And so in practice it's all in Erica.

501
01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:31.960
Zeljko Ivezic: You take part of the sample for testing

502
01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:45.110
Zeljko Ivezic: you have to think about what you're doing. And then, if basically, if you're selecting the next movie of Netflix for your customer. You have different sets of problems than if you are doing scientific paper

503
01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:55.559
Zeljko Ivezic: in stem fields. Or if you are into this Buddhist, and you have to decide, based on some measurements, whether someone give you further and then they'll end up being.

504
01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:06.109
Zeljko Ivezic: I don't know, depending on country, something that happens to them. So each of these applications carries different set of problems. And you need to be specific.

505
01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:12.910
Zeljko Ivezic: Exactly.

506
01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:13.790
I mean.

507
01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.189
Zeljko Ivezic: good time invasion.

508
01:08:18.939 --> 01:08:19.890
Things

509
01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:36.640
Zeljko Ivezic: exactly exactly like in astronomy. Published wrong paper. Okay, it looks stupid. But it should misdiagnose the patient. Go ahead.

510
01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:42.809
Zeljko Ivezic: That's a verity problem. I mean, essentially, the question of certain.

511
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:48.619
Zeljko Ivezic: Exactly. Yeah, it comes down to these false positives, false negatives.

512
01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.909
Zeljko Ivezic: true position on electricity.

513
01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:56.479
Zeljko Ivezic: But

514
01:08:57.310 --> 01:09:14.450
Zeljko Ivezic: and then there's this problem like training samples that you extrapolate is often happens in astronomy that you train your classifier based on brighter sample and then extend their objects. And then very often you get nonsense results.

515
01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:21.859
Zeljko Ivezic: More questions

516
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:27.640
Zeljko Ivezic: woke up. So here

517
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:29.390
Zeljko Ivezic: coming.

518
01:09:30.439 --> 01:09:31.600
Zeljko Ivezic: Thank you.

519
01:09:32.770 --> 01:09:33.729
Zeljko Ivezic: No.

520
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:35.909
Zeljko Ivezic: if you want to.

521
01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:42.610
Zeljko Ivezic: Right. So then,

522
01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:56.379
Zeljko Ivezic: if I need.

523
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:14.140
Zeljko Ivezic: So you start with 2 clusters and with 3, 4. And you look at this metric, and then once you get to the need points, then it say, now I captured most of the structure.

524
01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:18.390
Zeljko Ivezic: and as you said, it could go up infinity. But

525
01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:22.609
Zeljko Ivezic: it's open. And in these methods that you improve rapidly.

526
01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:32.539
Zeljko Ivezic: And then you have this need some entry, and then it's less than out. And basically, once you go with this split part, your model becomes more and more

527
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:33.670
Zeljko Ivezic: complex.

528
01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:39.040
Zeljko Ivezic: and you can fit better and better. But at some point, you're fitting just noise in your sample.

529
01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:47.029
Zeljko Ivezic: And that's why it's flattened out. So basically, it's when this happens to know that the technique you reach nearly optimal

530
01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:52.820
Zeljko Ivezic: optimal model. And then sometimes

531
01:10:52.900 --> 01:11:04.809
Zeljko Ivezic: you can explicitly compute the IC or even the full model of ability. Sometimes it's basically just some other metrics like in bill. See? Next week, in principle component analysis.

532
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:08.890
Zeljko Ivezic: you basically look at the residual variance in your sample.

533
01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:24.550
Zeljko Ivezic: and also it will go down fast, and then it will fatten out, and the more components you have. the more variance can explain. And then, if you have as many components as data points then remaining various 0. You exactly.

534
01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:29.610
Zeljko Ivezic: you know. Like, if you have thousands spectrum and you have.

535
01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:34.250
Zeljko Ivezic: you have a linear expansion. It's 1,000 idle spectrum.

536
01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:47.389
Zeljko Ivezic: Then you can explain. It's just linear system of linear equations install for it. And then you can explain each spectrum with 1,000 items spectrum. And that's just the rotation, multi-dimensional space.

537
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:57.590
Zeljko Ivezic: It becomes the principle component analysis. Once you say, I will touch the serious, and I'm not going to use thousands spectr, but only 5,000 spectrum.

538
01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:02.330
Zeljko Ivezic: Now that becomes dimensionality reduction and

539
01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:19.370
Zeljko Ivezic: useful methods, and when you look at the variance it will cut it. It's exactly when you go fast down, and then you flatten out. And if you went to the maximum number, which is the sample size, as you pointed out, for payings, you do get answered at 0. That's optimal.

540
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:21.370
Zeljko Ivezic: But that's very complex matter.

541
01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:23.420
Zeljko Ivezic: I mean model that that's

542
01:12:23.530 --> 01:12:28.629
Zeljko Ivezic: if you have 1,000 components, it's much more complex method than 5 components.

543
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:39.810
Zeljko Ivezic: Sometimes you can explicitly compute model probability or Vic, sometimes those other metrics that show. So when we computed Vic, we saw the same effect

544
01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:43.180
Zeljko Ivezic: that you go down like here

545
01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:47.620
Zeljko Ivezic: or the other one with asterisk tool, you rapidly go down.

546
01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:58.169
Zeljko Ivezic: and then it's left and out. So now you captured all this structure in your data, and the more complex, the model becomes the more of the noise.

547
01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:12.710
Zeljko Ivezic: And so if you increase number of components like, if you fit polynomial to your data points, and you, you have third order polynomial, and you fit into the data point. You get some Chi square. If you go with the fourth order polynomial.

548
01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:17.900
Zeljko Ivezic: your high sphere must be smaller because you have more model parameters.

549
01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:21.100
Zeljko Ivezic: But you are not going to fix twentieth order polynomial.

550
01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:29.230
Zeljko Ivezic: even though it will be even smaller. That's fair, because when you look at the IC or model probability, it will penalize it for the model complexity.

551
01:13:30.170 --> 01:13:50.719
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's similar. So this is not here. It's Vic. But in some other metrics it just comes down and looks like the IC. And so the reason why it's the same. It's not Vic, but it's if you capture the structure that you see, and then you start hitting noise. And so these to connect. That's where you should pick your model.

552
01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.790
Zeljko Ivezic: More questions. How do we call it? Today?

553
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:08.360
Zeljko Ivezic: I have rioty for next time, too.

554
01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:22.770
Zeljko Ivezic: Other questions on Zoom. Let me see. Okay, I did repeat some. I don't know how good job I did by everyone on zoom

555
01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.660
lovro: bye, bye.
