00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.530
Zeljko Ivezic: Hello! Can you hear me?

2
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.320
Lovro: Yes, I can hear you. We'll allow them there.

3
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.920
Zeljko Ivezic: Can people on zoom. Hear me?

4
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.860
Akshay Kumar Remeshan: This is your audible.

5
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.460
Akshay Kumar Remeshan: and please.

6
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.640
Zeljko Ivezic: all right.

7
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.720
Lovro: Can you

8
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.950
Zeljko Ivezic: shout if there are questions on chat.

9
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.380
Lovro: you got it?

10
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.540
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay?

11
00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.770
Lovro: Do you prefer to be interrupted as soon as

12
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.430
Zeljko Ivezic: say again.

13
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.120
Zeljko Ivezic: the moment I didn't touch that.

14
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.230
Zeljko Ivezic: Hello! Welcome back. So I guess last time it wasn't so bad that you would fix

15
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:54.960
Zeljko Ivezic: so they will do second stepping stone To what's the main topic that we will start next time. So today we will introduce the concept of maximum likelihood

16
00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.950
Zeljko Ivezic: before we continue. Are there any questions from last time that you would like to ask.

17
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.530
Zeljko Ivezic: I probably did. Yeah.

18
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:27.450
Zeljko Ivezic: but nothing fundamental. Maybe some bug or something. If you do get pull, you should get everything that is activate. And in particular there is zoom recording links to we have from the last time

19
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.150
Zeljko Ivezic: I did it. Yeah, that 4 different types of files.

20
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.520
Zeljko Ivezic: One is just plain text. Please

21
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.390
Zeljko Ivezic: transcript every 4. I think it's all about this

22
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.270
Zeljko Ivezic: on many downloads.

23
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.490
Thanks

24
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.690
Zeljko Ivezic: for 10Â min without what

25
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.440
Zeljko Ivezic: I think he's good without sound. That's right. So I did not turn the microphone on.

26
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.810
Zeljko Ivezic: You learn as you did

27
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:22.870
Zeljko Ivezic: so Today we'll introduce the concept of maximum likelihood. I'm not going to go into mathematical fears and proving things just.

28
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:35.330
Zeljko Ivezic: I will list some practical aspects of what we can do with that maximum likelihood. And in particular, I talk about connections to Bayesian statistics in the context of

29
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.390
Zeljko Ivezic: that method.

30
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.700
Zeljko Ivezic: So let me just find the optimal resolution.

31
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.890
Zeljko Ivezic: Let me see anything from the back. If I try to get everything in my screen, then the phone becomes very small.

32
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.880
Zeljko Ivezic: Is this too small in the back? You can also have it on your laptop. I guess

33
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:19.029
Zeljko Ivezic: so in the concept of my of likelihood and maximum, like the good as a method, we assume that we understand the process that generates today.

34
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:28.420
Zeljko Ivezic: And so the simplest example of such a process is that we say we are generating our data from a Gaussian distribution

35
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.570
Zeljko Ivezic: that has 2 parameters. For example, you want to measure the weight of all people

36
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.950
Zeljko Ivezic: alright. that we you

37
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:48.040
Zeljko Ivezic: or you, want to find out the distribution of the weight of a bread loaf from call zoom.

38
00:04:48.230 --> 00:05:04.580
Zeljko Ivezic: and the bit of that distribution. How if you buy a kilogram of bread, is it always kilogram, or is it a little bit less or more. And what is the schedule? So this is Gaussian distribution. It can be in theory, any other distribution, and we will later. Look at

39
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.550
Zeljko Ivezic: binomial distribution that describes some coins like

40
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.630
Zeljko Ivezic: and many other interesting cases that are addressed in science with exactly the same distribution.

41
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:30.380
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you assume that you know the underlying distribution from which you generate your data. then the likelihood of that data, data, likelihood or probability that you will get a measurement between X

42
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:37.150
Zeljko Ivezic: and X plus Dx is simply given by the underlying distribution for a given data point.

43
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:47.410
Zeljko Ivezic: And then, if you have many data points, and this is crucial step. We assume that they are independent of each other.

44
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:58.150
Zeljko Ivezic: They could. I usually call I Ids where I Id stands for identical, independent, identically distributed variables.

45
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.800
Zeljko Ivezic: So we assume that each measurement is roll from that same distribution.

46
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:22.480
Zeljko Ivezic: but that each measurement has nothing to do with any other measurement; that it's output does not depend on previous measurements. It's not always true. We do have measurements where successive values are correlated, and that's addressed in different way with covariance. Matrices.

47
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:44.640
Zeljko Ivezic: and in particular Gaussian process. Regression became super popular over the last decade or so. But we'll talk about that later, for now we'll assume that each measurement is independent of each other, and then a whole set of measurements. It's probability. It's like it's simply given by the products of these individual probabilities.

48
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:53.990
Zeljko Ivezic: So the first line shows probability of a given measurement, single measurement, index by I, and then the second line multiplies over all these.

49
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.920
Zeljko Ivezic: so to make it less abstract. There is a very, very simple example here.

50
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:15.780
Zeljko Ivezic: So i'm reading Sam. Actually, this is an online. I could have removed it. That's from the old phase of iphone 2, and it was important things from by 1, 3. So what I'm going to do now is I'll draw 3 data points. You see number 3 here.

51
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:21.610
Zeljko Ivezic: and that will drove from Gaussian centered on one. and this

52
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.780
Zeljko Ivezic: standard deviation, or Sigma of Point 2, so i'll throw 3 numbers randomly.

53
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:39.070
Zeljko Ivezic: and there will be around one, not exactly one, because it's a distribution, and then they actually I can execute this again. I got something different. Now do I like it

54
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.010
Zeljko Ivezic: 2 points almost identical. That's why I put

55
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.910
Zeljko Ivezic: this call here random seed, 4 to 2 to guarantee that I always get points

56
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:54.890
Zeljko Ivezic: that the goods from the pedagogical point of view, they that different sometimes they are very similar. So that's been on me.

57
00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:03.620
Zeljko Ivezic: These are my x, I. X, one, x, 2, x, 3. I'll go back to this formula and calculate likelihood for

58
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.440
Zeljko Ivezic: new for each of them. So given data points.

59
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:16.820
Zeljko Ivezic: I can say, what is the the probability of given value of me. So if I drew 1.1,

60
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:17.990
Zeljko Ivezic: then

61
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:32.620
Zeljko Ivezic: we can see that meals should be around. It cannot be 1 million or minus 1 million. It should be of the other one would be one data point. I have no clue about the scatter about the weight of the distribution, but as soon as I have few points, I can constrain it.

62
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.600
Zeljko Ivezic: And so what this block of code does

63
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:45.050
Zeljko Ivezic: generates me on grade 0 to 2, and then calculate likelihood function for each data point and then multiplies as we showed earlier.

64
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.480
Zeljko Ivezic: And so this is now the main point.

65
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.610
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you take the red line.

66
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.930
Zeljko Ivezic: deadline cancer of the measurement

67
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.190
Zeljko Ivezic: that head value of point, something point 9 7. So that measurement, says

68
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:08.940
Zeljko Ivezic: my. Therefore the most likely value of new is point 97

69
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.110
Zeljko Ivezic: as simple as that.

70
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:17.810
Zeljko Ivezic: But then there is another measurement that says, Wait a minute. My value is 1.1,

71
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:30.750
Zeljko Ivezic: I think, that the most probable value of new is 1.1, and each measurement will make the same statement where it claims that it's centered on text value, and then which is the zoom known to point to.

72
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:38.750
Zeljko Ivezic: So how now, how do we reconcile these different statements by different measurements that we simply multiply

73
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:45.500
Zeljko Ivezic: these functions, this what likelihoods individual one. We multiply a red screen and blue line.

74
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.150
Zeljko Ivezic: and their product is the black one.

75
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.910
Zeljko Ivezic: It's the overall

76
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:59.050
Zeljko Ivezic: data likelihood. And so the black line now tells you. Your most probable value is the peak of this is like 1.0 something.

77
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:08.210
Zeljko Ivezic: and it gives you this with that, as you increase, the number of measurements would be narrower and narrower. As you multiply many of these Gaussians.

78
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.510
Zeljko Ivezic: so there's the concept of likelihood.

79
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:15.740
Zeljko Ivezic: and so to find the most probable value. We find the peak of the black term.

80
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.220
Zeljko Ivezic: Obviously we take first derivative of that.

81
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:28.720
Zeljko Ivezic: and equate to 0, and then for the uncertainty of that value, it depends on the which of this distribution. So we take second derivative of the overall likelihood.

82
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.990
Zeljko Ivezic: And that's how you can solve the problem.

83
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.310
Zeljko Ivezic: And

84
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:39.830
Zeljko Ivezic: it's that's basically the maximum like that. So let's see more, few more details.

85
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:50.060
Zeljko Ivezic: This shows what happens If you have measurements with different certain. You have one balancing measurement and one precise measurement, either because

86
00:10:50.160 --> 00:11:00.570
Zeljko Ivezic: you don't have better instruments, or you have better procedure over the next right to start in the astronomy or whatever, so that tool.

87
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:12.530
Zeljko Ivezic: 3 and direct green is cool, better right. and the red is bad measure like it is very large with. When you multiply that you get something that is very close to Green.

88
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:23.660
Zeljko Ivezic: So this shows that in this concept of likelihood that good measurements you have more statistical power, and then bad measurements. And indeed, you must get

89
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:31.850
Zeljko Ivezic: worked with weighted sons and weighted means in one of your science labs. And so those weighted some.

90
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:37.460
Zeljko Ivezic: They are derived by following as possible, like a good approach, and we'll see that in a moment.

91
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:44.070
Zeljko Ivezic: Another thing is that if one of these measurements, for example, is the Delta function.

92
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:51.350
Zeljko Ivezic: that means that if it's, uncertainty is so small that, compared to the other measurement.

93
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.490
Zeljko Ivezic: it's a central 0 bit function.

94
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:58.150
Zeljko Ivezic: then that measurement by itself. You overpower everything else.

95
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.010
Zeljko Ivezic: In other words, if you talk to some stubborn person.

96
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:16.880
Zeljko Ivezic: and that someone person is not like scientists, it doesn't allow for uncertainty in statements, they know exactly what they're talking about. There is no point in argument to that person, because, whatever you say, they have infinite in their own

97
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.190
Zeljko Ivezic: view, the role that you cannot change.

98
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:25.800
Zeljko Ivezic: You know the story about lion and donkey arguing whether the grass is blue.

99
00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:33.890
Zeljko Ivezic: Nope. and they couldn't agree, and they go to No. Sorry it was a line. It was tiger, tiger, and donkey.

100
00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:43.090
Zeljko Ivezic: They go to Lion, the King of the for us to decide who is right. and Lion says, Yes, of course the glass is blue.

101
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:58.760
Zeljko Ivezic: I told you I told you. and so he leaves, and Tiger says to the line like. but they're talking about. You know that the grass is green. says Yes, of course I know the grass is green, but I said, it's blue to punish you for arguing with the donkey.

102
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:19.580
Zeljko Ivezic: And so, as we have more and more data points as you multiply it, as I would say, if it's a slightly offset. But the zoom will be similar with then you're over. Out with it'll become narrow and error. And this is now again numerical example of a sample of 10 data points.

103
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:30.060
Zeljko Ivezic: So these blue lines that 10 measured data points. Now it's shown on the log logarithmic scale on y-axis to emphasize the weight of these distributions.

104
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:38.580
Zeljko Ivezic: and so if you look at any one of them, they're still substantial, very far from the center. But once you multiply 10 of them.

105
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:50.080
Zeljko Ivezic: then these wings, which are much less than one. Multiply each other, and you suppress rings, and the overall final likelihood is this green line, and you can see, like, if you look at the

106
00:13:50.290 --> 00:14:03.370
Zeljko Ivezic: at the range of values Here it's ruled out. You already know that your true value cannot be that far out, and that's because you had 10 measurements, and you have this small values to the power of 10, and you suppress them.

107
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:08.330
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is the origin of essentially central limit theorem

108
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.060
Zeljko Ivezic: that tells you that the mean value of your sample

109
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:28.410
Zeljko Ivezic: they'll be scattered around truth. It's it's schedul that is proportional to one over square root of N. The n is the number of measurements. That's why we do many measurements in the lab, usually at least 10

110
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:33.620
Zeljko Ivezic: to get this tail clipping, and we'll show more detail later about it.

111
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:44.690
Zeljko Ivezic: Another thing to know about likelihood is that usually we don't work with these products. We work with some it's easier to

112
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:51.510
Zeljko Ivezic: maximize. They want to minimize them. So we take log of that product, and then log becomes

113
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:59.660
Zeljko Ivezic: the the sum. Another thing to remember is that likelihood is not a true probability distribution.

114
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:14.640
Zeljko Ivezic: So each individual likelihood comes from probability distribution that is normalized to one that Gaussian distribution that we assume. But when you multiply now many Gaussians. It is not normalized to one anymore.

115
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.640
Zeljko Ivezic: And indeed the the normalization, the the final

116
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:25.280
Zeljko Ivezic: height of that peak like in that grain peak that has to do with the probability of that model.

117
00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:29.410
Zeljko Ivezic: Given the daytime, we will talk about it in lectures, 3 and 4,

118
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:46.370
Zeljko Ivezic: so we can. Now, okay, so this is that story about product going into some, and then another quick note. We can also generalize this to multi-dimensional spaces

119
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.280
Zeljko Ivezic: and it doesn't have to be uncorrelated to date the point. So in general this expression

120
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:58.080
Zeljko Ivezic: that may look intimidating, but actually it's quite simple. This is matrix form of the Covariance matrix.

121
00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.020
Zeljko Ivezic: and you can then

122
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:08.680
Zeljko Ivezic: express that behavior in multi-dimensional space of Gaussians, that the covariance which means they are not aligned with access.

123
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:26.630
Zeljko Ivezic: but they are misaligned. And this way you can also treat data points that the correlated with with each other. You are not going to go into details of that because of time constraint. But this is just a notes to know that you don't have to give up on your data analysis. If your data points are correlated.

124
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:40.750
Zeljko Ivezic: and also they'll say more later. But this whole business of likelihood is directly related to so called I Square, that you probably also heard about in some of your introductory labs.

125
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.610
Zeljko Ivezic: So we will show what is the connection and what is the true meaning of that.

126
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.300
Zeljko Ivezic: But before we further develop these details

127
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:57.170
Zeljko Ivezic: we'll do a couple of very simple examples just to give you a feel for what we do with this

128
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:02.120
Zeljko Ivezic: like liquid. So first we will consider case of a Gaussian

129
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:10.950
Zeljko Ivezic: in case of so-called heterosexual errors, which is cool words, which means every data point is different uncertainty

130
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:12.880
Zeljko Ivezic: If you're

131
00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:18.849
Zeljko Ivezic: the entire data set, if you're all data points at the same on certain feet

132
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:28.990
Zeljko Ivezic: today, and we call it foremost, fantastic. So here we will assume this model. The first line says: Probability of my data points

133
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:42.430
Zeljko Ivezic: is given by this Gaussian, and note that Sigma is indexed by all. So the model physical model that we had in mind here is that we are measuring something. Many times.

134
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.540
Zeljko Ivezic: Each measurement has Sigma high certainty.

135
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:54.780
Zeljko Ivezic: and whatever intrinsic a certainty may exist, it's negligible compared to every.

136
00:17:55.370 --> 00:18:05.520
Zeljko Ivezic: So we put has many measurements of a single unique object. Say, you want to measure mass of a planet of Mars. There is only one Mars.

137
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:11.360
Zeljko Ivezic: and so it's a single object. There is no schedule, and we measure it many times in Sigma I.

138
00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:25.740
Zeljko Ivezic: The other extreme example that we will consider is when our measurement is so good that measurement of certainty is negligible compared to intrinsic schedule of a sample.

139
00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:31.090
Zeljko Ivezic: And that would be, for example, asking, what is the waste distribution

140
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:42.580
Zeljko Ivezic: off formally? 1Â kg of of bread. If you get some consume, and then it gets to your tennis, you can measure it's rate. It's precision of one brand.

141
00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:51.550
Zeljko Ivezic: and you know that both of bread has to vary around 1Â kg by at least 10 times that month, because it's impossible to make each loss you.

142
00:18:52.020 --> 00:19:01.380
Zeljko Ivezic: And so in this case it would have different extremes where there are no individual measurements, measurement, errors that we care about. But we want to determine what to signal.

143
00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:13.240
Zeljko Ivezic: So let's Look first at this example, where we assume there is no intrinsic scheduled. So we are measuring something. Well, we find this is the simplest possible example.

144
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.260
Zeljko Ivezic: and you have

145
00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:20.950
Zeljko Ivezic: and data points, and then you ask what is my best estimate of new.

146
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:28.120
Zeljko Ivezic: And so first I write my overall likelihood. Then I went to.

147
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.530
Zeljko Ivezic: I went to Lord Space, so product became sun.

148
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:47.190
Zeljko Ivezic: And now I have this second order, polynomial. Note that this number 2, the power of 2 comes from the Gaussian expression. Later we will see that actually this little 2 goes all the way to the square method.

149
00:19:47.290 --> 00:20:01.120
Zeljko Ivezic: The reason why we have this square method is that we assume it was Gaussian distribution. So now I have these likelihoods. So if I maximize log of likelihood at the same time, I'm also maximizing livelihood.

150
00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:09.030
Zeljko Ivezic: and it's easier to work with log. So I have this expression, and I need to find new that maximizes it.

151
00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:17.250
Zeljko Ivezic: And so that's easy. I basically take derivative of that expression with respect to you, equate to 0

152
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:18.900
Zeljko Ivezic: rearrange.

153
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:25.400
Zeljko Ivezic: and I get my results from you, not for my best estimate of new. Given the data set.

154
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.570
Zeljko Ivezic: And basically that's a weighted son

155
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:35.780
Zeljko Ivezic: of your measurements, where weight is one over Sigma I Square.

156
00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.660
Zeljko Ivezic: So the rate

157
00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:49.640
Zeljko Ivezic: increase. If your measurement uncertainty decrease. That's exactly the example we had before. Where we had. Where is it this lousy and good measurements?

158
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.790
Zeljko Ivezic: So now, when I add this to my add

159
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.730
Zeljko Ivezic: green and red.

160
00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:02.760
Zeljko Ivezic: I don't add green and red weights equally. I give much more weight to the green line.

161
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.130
Zeljko Ivezic: because

162
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.540
Zeljko Ivezic: green line has much smaller uncertainty.

163
00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:08.460
Zeljko Ivezic: So

164
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:21.360
Zeljko Ivezic: together at the end they give this posterior probability that is very similar to green line, much more similar than to red line. and that happens because the weight is in terms of propulsion.

165
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.510
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is basically

166
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:32.710
Zeljko Ivezic: formula that you teach that you learn in introductory science labs how to add bunch of measurements to get the best

167
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.240
Zeljko Ivezic: estimate of what you measure it.

168
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:39.300
Zeljko Ivezic: Given that you had a very uncertainty measurement.

169
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:56.750
Zeljko Ivezic: Now you could assume that all your measurements have the same as certainty. Let's call it Sigma, so it's no index, and you can show that. So I forgot to emphasize the second one. The uncertainty from you is obtained by taking second derivative. Of the

170
00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:07.830
Zeljko Ivezic: of the likelihood function, and then you get from curvature you get this uncertainty. And now, if you assume all Sigma, are the same. You will get this expression, that uncertainty of your

171
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.960
Zeljko Ivezic: estimator mu your your, your your estimate of what you were measuring

172
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:23.370
Zeljko Ivezic: goes down as one of the square root of N. That is the number of measurements. That's why we teach our undergraduate students that you need to take at least 10 measurements.

173
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:28.730
Zeljko Ivezic: because it goes down with and And actually

174
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:36.880
Zeljko Ivezic: there is another even better reason why we need to repeat measurements in lab to at least 10, and we'll learn that later that we

175
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:43.250
Zeljko Ivezic: we do not reach this Gaussian behavior until we have at least about 10 10 measurements.

176
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.710
Zeljko Ivezic: Yeah.

177
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.530
Okay.

178
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.970
Okay. Okay.

179
00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.140
Zeljko Ivezic: right. See?

180
00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:23.480
Zeljko Ivezic: No, we calculate what is the

181
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.990
Zeljko Ivezic: we know that this is the best point.

182
00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:32.480
Zeljko Ivezic: Now, if it's very flat at the bottom, then all these values are allowed to have like bottom

183
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:39.610
Zeljko Ivezic: thing. If it's very short, then you know, you have to be in that region, and that these regions are excluded.

184
00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.930
Zeljko Ivezic: So it's basically like those sales we looked at.

185
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.920
Zeljko Ivezic: So here, as you add more of these points.

186
00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:52.770
Zeljko Ivezic: I only showed green line for the end when I added all 10 points.

187
00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:59.720
Zeljko Ivezic: But if I plot it green line, for when we had 5 points it would look similar, but it stays extended. Yes.

188
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:08.970
Zeljko Ivezic: so as you get more voice, you make it narrow, narrow, narrow, narrow, and the information about that narrowness is measured by the second derivative of this function.

189
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:21.320
Zeljko Ivezic: Exactly. Now, then, I know I put it this I So the more problem function you have, the better you constrain the value.

190
00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:29.760
Zeljko Ivezic: and then asymptotic limit. Of course it's delta function. So if you had infinite number of points. Then you would end up with

191
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:45.680
Zeljko Ivezic: Jaco. Can you please repeat the questions for the people online? Because we can't hear them? Why do we get uncertainty of that best estimate to a new

192
00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:49.950
Zeljko Ivezic: by using the second derivative of the likelihood?

193
00:24:50.670 --> 00:25:00.070
Zeljko Ivezic: And the reason is that the second you heard the explanation. So it measures. How wide is this posterior function green right now on the screen?

194
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.430
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay, docking. Thank you.

195
00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.020
Zeljko Ivezic: So

196
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:23.340
Zeljko Ivezic: okay. So this justifies this formula for rating mean? Why is it weighted by one over Sigma Square, and not, for example, by one over Sigma or any other power?

197
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.280
Zeljko Ivezic: This tells you why it is square.

198
00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:35.620
Zeljko Ivezic: And again, this particular formulae are true. Only if you really have your measurements follow Gaussian distribution.

199
00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:48.900
Zeljko Ivezic: and it could be something else, Some other function, and we'll see another example late. Okay. So now we go to this other. We go to this other extreme, where our measurement errors

200
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:58.640
Zeljko Ivezic: are so small that we completely neglect them, compared to the intrinsic distribution of the quantity that we are.

201
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.680
Zeljko Ivezic: So Again, my examples include measuring

202
00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:14.050
Zeljko Ivezic: loss of bread from consume that has some intrinsic scatter or measuring the weight of Router Bosco, which people that has since better, or you can think of anything else from your own field.

203
00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:20.860
Zeljko Ivezic: It's not hard to think of these examples. So the question is, if I have these measurements. X. I.

204
00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:25.480
Zeljko Ivezic: How do I get my best estimators of New and Sigma?

205
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:30.900
Zeljko Ivezic: Do they depend on each other? How do they behave with increase of the sample, etc.?

206
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:46.970
Zeljko Ivezic: So again, it's exactly the same first step you write the product, your likelihood, and the only difference compared to the previous example is that this Sigma is not Sigma I anymore. It's just Sigma that Sigma means something else.

207
00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:52.580
Zeljko Ivezic: It's not measurable uncertainty anymore. It is now in intrinsic scatter.

208
00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.940
Zeljko Ivezic: and that thing that i'm measuring whatever it may be.

209
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.870
Zeljko Ivezic: And now it's 2 dimensional.

210
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.550
Zeljko Ivezic: And so when you take logarithm.

211
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:17.620
Zeljko Ivezic: and here I think I had bug here in the previous version of this lecture. So I updated just this morning. So if you, if you downloaded lecture earlier than like 10 or 11 am, is morning, you probably have different from, for the

212
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:19.220
Zeljko Ivezic: this one is correct.

213
00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.680
Zeljko Ivezic: I forgot to put them in in front of B.

214
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:28.620
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is now exactly the same formula. except that I introduced

215
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:36.300
Zeljko Ivezic: X bar, which is short for the mean value of X. Basically some effects divided by N.

216
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:40.780
Zeljko Ivezic: And I introduced capital B, which is

217
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:48.540
Zeljko Ivezic: standard, deviation, sphere or variance. And again, it's just explicit formula that comes directly from data.

218
00:27:48.590 --> 00:28:02.390
Zeljko Ivezic: These are just abbreviations. So I don't have to write those zoom sums every time, so we can summarize completely our data set in just 2 numbers. You calculate X bar the main value.

219
00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:15.020
Zeljko Ivezic: and you calculate the variance. So it's standard aviation, but it's formula. and that's it. There are only 2 numbers that completely summarize the data set. and then your likelihood is function of 2 variables.

220
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:19.850
Zeljko Ivezic: And so I will first scroll through the code to show you the picture.

221
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.550
Zeljko Ivezic: So here you can see

222
00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:26.060
Zeljko Ivezic: it doesn't look like perfect Gaussian. It's

223
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:36.900
Zeljko Ivezic: kind of opening towards large y axis values, which is Sigma. So it is symmetric to the left and right. But it's definitely not a simple Gaussian.

224
00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.190
Zeljko Ivezic: and its exact shape

225
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:51.970
Zeljko Ivezic: depends on what is the actually the variance of this compared to mean, and it depends on number of points in your sample. If now we increase the number of points.

226
00:28:52.300 --> 00:29:01.600
Zeljko Ivezic: then we would get closer and closer to a perfect Gaussian distribution. So we can try to do that. And it should work, I think, on your computer, too.

227
00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:08.970
Zeljko Ivezic: So here is Here's the code. This is where we assume it's a Gaussian

228
00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:14.060
Zeljko Ivezic: That's the the only assumption regarding what kind of model we have.

229
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.020
Zeljko Ivezic: and then we choose

230
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:20.660
Zeljko Ivezic: these values. I don't actually generate the whole data set.

231
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:29.780
Zeljko Ivezic: since we proved that you just need to know mean value, variance and number of points. And so, if I didn't break something if I execute this.

232
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.720
Zeljko Ivezic: Huh? It works.

233
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:41.710
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay. So now let's see what will happen if I put an 100. I have much larger sample, same variance, same

234
00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.150
Zeljko Ivezic: me and value.

235
00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:55.110
Zeljko Ivezic: Huh! Did you see that? So? First, it's much smaller. and second, it's much more symmetric, and looking like a Gaussian. So that means

236
00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:07.190
Zeljko Ivezic: that now these values of New and Sigma are much better constraints. I ruled out all that space that was in black, like means some finite probability by it means 0 probability.

237
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.020
Zeljko Ivezic: So now, with larger sample, it's almost circular.

238
00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:15.270
Zeljko Ivezic: And so another conclusion we can draw is that it's symmetric

239
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:29.710
Zeljko Ivezic: with respect to X and Y, which means that for Gaussian estimates of New it's Sigma are not Covariance, meaning they don't depend on each other, meaning conditional probability distributions will always be identified.

240
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:41.670
Zeljko Ivezic: They are not prepared now, trying to see if you can do that on your left. Let's see what happens with 1,000 cool. What number should we put in to break the code?

241
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:49.390
Zeljko Ivezic: Don't be afraid to break the code unless you're teaching them? Don't. Try to.

242
00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:53.340
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay. So there's the basic idea.

243
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:58.270
Zeljko Ivezic: So then a quick comment on

244
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:20.810
Zeljko Ivezic: quick comment on confidence interval versus credible region. I'm. Jumping ahead a little bit to Bayesian statistics mathematically or or or numerically. These are exactly the same expressions. So when I compute my new value, and I know that it's uncertain to Sigma over.

245
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:25.270
Zeljko Ivezic: there is philosophical difference. So not America

246
00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:32.800
Zeljko Ivezic: numerical. It's exactly the same number philosophical difference between the so called frequentist statistic.

247
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:44.730
Zeljko Ivezic: and by Asian interpretation in classical statistics that most of you learn in school, because by, you see, and it's still fighting to get into textbooks. So in classical statistics.

248
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:49.530
Zeljko Ivezic: what does that mean is interval? That means that if we imagine

249
00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.060
Zeljko Ivezic: 110,000

250
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:58.570
Zeljko Ivezic: experiments, a large number of identical, statistically identical experiments.

251
00:31:58.860 --> 00:31:59.940
Zeljko Ivezic: Then

252
00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:08.560
Zeljko Ivezic: confidence interval tells you that in 68 of those experiments you'll actually get new estimator to form

253
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:10.820
Zeljko Ivezic: the true meal to fall in that estimate.

254
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:19.300
Zeljko Ivezic: Now there is nothing wrong with that statement. It's all correct. except this is not question that we are asking in science

255
00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:23.570
Zeljko Ivezic: what we are really asking in science is, I measured something.

256
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.250
Zeljko Ivezic: I have set of measurements.

257
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:33.570
Zeljko Ivezic: Tell me what is the expected probability distribution for my parameter of interest.

258
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:38.240
Zeljko Ivezic: I don't have 100 or thousands of 10,000 identical measurements.

259
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:50.330
Zeljko Ivezic: I just have my own data set, and i'm trying to ask different questions. and that's different. Question is answered by slightly different approach to probability that it's called by Asian

260
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.340
Zeljko Ivezic: statistics, and we'll we'll talk more about it next time.

261
00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.190
Zeljko Ivezic: Then

262
00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:00.410
Zeljko Ivezic: let me then summarize here as this first part.

263
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:04.340
Zeljko Ivezic: so that bunch of theorems here that sometimes in textbooks

264
00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:14.050
Zeljko Ivezic: take many pages. I don't think we need to prove anything. You'll take my word for it, or if you come from theoretical side, you may want to look them up.

265
00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:18.200
Zeljko Ivezic: So one property of these estimators is that they are consistent.

266
00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:25.060
Zeljko Ivezic: Which means that if you have huge data set you will get unbiased results.

267
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.550
Zeljko Ivezic: Eventually they will converge

268
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:31.020
Zeljko Ivezic: towards the true value. They are unbiased.

269
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:36.920
Zeljko Ivezic: That's what it means. Second one, that asymptotically normal estimators, which means

270
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:44.280
Zeljko Ivezic: that eventually, when you have large sample, the scatter around the true value will be Gaussian.

271
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:52.450
Zeljko Ivezic: That's related to central limit theorem, and it's related to those sales that we are clipping when we have more data points.

272
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:54.640
Zeljko Ivezic: And finally.

273
00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:06.080
Zeljko Ivezic: they you can show that if you take unbiased estimator, then the uncertainty of the estimator is the smallest possible. If you do likelihood maximization.

274
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:23.000
Zeljko Ivezic: You cannot be it. This is the best you can do if you have unbiased, estimated. But today there is a whole new branch of statistics where you assume there is, so you add some bias in order to minimize the scatter. It's a whole new field that i'm completely skipping.

275
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:33.679
Zeljko Ivezic: so summarize how to be applied. So the key point is, you need to understand your measurement process, for

276
00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:43.670
Zeljko Ivezic: you need some P. To understand what generates uncertainty in your measurements, and what is the underlying distribution from which you draw your Sam.

277
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:46.050
Zeljko Ivezic: And so if you know this.

278
00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:53.310
Zeljko Ivezic: then once you write down likelihood, then it's straightforward to apply it. Basically it's first and second derivative

279
00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.780
Zeljko Ivezic: of whatever function you have.

280
00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:03.330
Zeljko Ivezic: So far we only play the Gaussian, but we'll do a few more examples of of different functions.

281
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:09.670
Zeljko Ivezic: So one more example from practice, where it becomes really important.

282
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:17.150
Zeljko Ivezic: So here I have a model for my measurements. I've assumed that I measure 2 things One and X.

283
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:20.950
Zeljko Ivezic: Let's say, i'm measuring how fast

284
00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.600
Zeljko Ivezic: 3 grows. There's a sign for how

285
00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:32.730
Zeljko Ivezic: much energy I extract from some process as a function of effective temperature, or whatever you can think of examples from your own view.

286
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:44.360
Zeljko Ivezic: Mathematically speaking, I have x and y. and this formula: there, says my Y, I I'm. Assuming a model where my? Why measurement is some function of X.

287
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:52.690
Zeljko Ivezic: So why there is a sex, the the simple things from the introductory lamb we are theta is a vector of free parameters.

288
00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:58.330
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you just look at the straight line in introductory land, usually they call it

289
00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:03.540
Zeljko Ivezic: y equals k x plus 7 or y equals a x plus b.

290
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:09.040
Zeljko Ivezic: These are them, or I'll x was baker. These are the most

291
00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:25.550
Zeljko Ivezic: here, because I want to go to arbitrary, complicated for me, not me. Out. I put all these 3 parameters into vector Take them. So a linear function is then theta 0, plus theta one x one. If I manage to any order aluminium, I will just step in terms.

292
00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:39.790
Zeljko Ivezic: So i'm assuming my measurement, Why is some function that i'll choose, and then, and 0, Sigma, I is abbreviation for the statements that I expect my measurement, uncertainty to be Gaussian

293
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:42.700
Zeljko Ivezic: known and given by Sigma.

294
00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:49.910
Zeljko Ivezic: The fact that it's 0. There it means it's unbiased. I don't have it's just some random sket

295
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:58.160
Zeljko Ivezic: So basically we are talking about regression about fitting and analytic function to my one-dimensional basis.

296
00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:00.670
Zeljko Ivezic: and when you

297
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:06.070
Zeljko Ivezic: write down like it with expression, it's very similar to what we had before.

298
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:15.440
Zeljko Ivezic: and then it will take derivative of Ln of L. With respect to each free parameter equates to 0. And if I have n

299
00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:26.120
Zeljko Ivezic: free parameters of hand and by end matrix, which I can, that linear problem which I can solve and get. It's explicit formulating for my efficiency.

300
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:32.160
Zeljko Ivezic: And indeed, when we teach undergrads and introductory lab, we just give the formula for

301
00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:39.090
Zeljko Ivezic: A and V, or theta now and theta one we give them explicit formula. You can say, compute the best.

302
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:51.240
Zeljko Ivezic: Now, if you wanted to do 10 for the Polynomial, then you would have many, many formulas. So in practice you either have some piece of code that someone else wrote that you call, or you do explicit numerical

303
00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:53.580
Zeljko Ivezic: minimization, as we will do in the moment.

304
00:37:54.130 --> 00:38:03.020
Zeljko Ivezic: So nowhere here, I assume what is the highest order of the Polynomial I could fit under it or the Polynomial with this expression.

305
00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:07.220
Zeljko Ivezic: And one interesting thing is that in the case of linear

306
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:15.020
Zeljko Ivezic: of the linear problem, when we saw this, these 2 leads to square in the least square.

307
00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:20.050
Zeljko Ivezic: So I mean, we have stamped that formula for fit in straight line to data.

308
00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:33.320
Zeljko Ivezic: We call it least square method, because we are minimizing squares of the difference between data in the model. And that's where comes from Gaussian assumption. If it was some different function.

309
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:36.680
Zeljko Ivezic: then it would be some different results.

310
00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:49.690
Zeljko Ivezic: So square only applies to Gaussian to Gaussian case. So here is a little bit of code that can fit any polynomial to any data

311
00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:52.890
Zeljko Ivezic: it's impressive. How cool it is by

312
00:38:53.290 --> 00:39:00.120
Zeljko Ivezic: like the first line we value is polynomial for any vector

313
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:01.420
Zeljko Ivezic: second.

314
00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:08.620
Zeljko Ivezic: second procedure or function Just compute the log likelihood that we can form it off.

315
00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:13.370
Zeljko Ivezic: for they're up. And the third one is calling

316
00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:20.510
Zeljko Ivezic: optimize to optimize numerically. That's function.

317
00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:27.000
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's all what you need that comes from sci-fi. It's all what you need to do any

318
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:32.360
Zeljko Ivezic: polynomial fit and so what i'm now going to do is i'll

319
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:38.880
Zeljko Ivezic: select 22 data points. I don't remember my

320
00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:43.030
Zeljko Ivezic: I chose to do example for the third.

321
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:50.810
Zeljko Ivezic: That's what anything true is 3, and i'm not trying to fit. You have to tell it which Polynomial wanted to.

322
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.700
Zeljko Ivezic: I'll go from 0 to 6.

323
00:39:54.330 --> 00:40:03.970
Zeljko Ivezic: And so what these lines do are they generate the grid. Then they generate some error, and then they add random noise

324
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.300
Zeljko Ivezic: to the

325
00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.660
Zeljko Ivezic: So let me show you the picture first, and then we can go back.

326
00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:20.760
Zeljko Ivezic: So here we have these black points that are 22 of them. and they are generated from the third order Polynomial, which is main line.

327
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:26.160
Zeljko Ivezic: they do not

328
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:28.790
Zeljko Ivezic: by any.

329
00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:32.090
Zeljko Ivezic: and this for those

330
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:36.280
Zeljko Ivezic: so called everyone box. These are the

331
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:42.460
Zeljko Ivezic: uncertainties that are used to generate.

332
00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:47.870
Zeljko Ivezic: and then we record this from 0 to 6, or from one to 6.

333
00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:52.030
Zeljko Ivezic: So First, I say, let this big, straight line

334
00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:57.680
Zeljko Ivezic: and you get blue. One is the best thing. Obviously it's a very

335
00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:03.570
Zeljko Ivezic: Then you take the orange line. It's the second order.

336
00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:07.770
Zeljko Ivezic: It's still for you.

337
00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:15.960
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you'll go with the third of that from you know which in this case the to answer, and you get a beautiful fit. That's the main one.

338
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:29.340
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you can try 4 or the point on them. 50 other polynomial, and so all of these are now good. So one question that comes immediately to one is, what is I didn't know.

339
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:35.530
Zeljko Ivezic: and not much.

340
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:48.210
Zeljko Ivezic: But let's say, now you're measuring some physical wall. You measure something, and you have to choose. is it? And maybe you could say

341
00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.040
Zeljko Ivezic: good and beautiful before.

342
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:56.850
Zeljko Ivezic: But you imagine now that you need to extrapolate this to the right. Let's say the X is.

343
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:59.550
Zeljko Ivezic: and you need to.

344
00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:04.580
Zeljko Ivezic: Then it's a big difference between

345
00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:06.440
Zeljko Ivezic: in practice they can.

346
00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:13.740
Zeljko Ivezic: so we would like to know

347
00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.520
Zeljko Ivezic: It's all that method.

348
00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:20.750
Okay?

349
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:26.310
Zeljko Ivezic: And then it will

350
00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.270
Zeljko Ivezic: sure. Majority of you already know that

351
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:31.790
Zeljko Ivezic: absolutely.

352
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.240
Oh.

353
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.750
Zeljko Ivezic: well, here it can be toy example

354
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.130
Zeljko Ivezic: in the

355
00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.440
Zeljko Ivezic: are you asking how good is that assumption? Or

356
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:07.170
Zeljko Ivezic: Well.

357
00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:16.570
Zeljko Ivezic: no, it's totally our assumption here. And so in in practice, Gaussian

358
00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:21.180
Zeljko Ivezic: comes often. but it's not your it to be true.

359
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:24.030
Zeljko Ivezic: So there are. They are cases

360
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:29.740
Zeljko Ivezic: where you can actually demonstrate that you have nearly Gaussian a certain distribution.

361
00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:32.490
Zeljko Ivezic: But there are also cases where it fails badly.

362
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:46.610
Zeljko Ivezic: And so for pedagogical reason, when we reduce the concepts, we usually look at Gaussian distribution because it gives you it gives you analytic solutions and simple cases, but in reality it can be anything. And indeed, in just

363
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:55.170
Zeljko Ivezic: couple of lines that will be comments about which are both of which are not Gaussian distributions. so hang in there for a few minutes, and we'll get back to that point.

364
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.360
Zeljko Ivezic: So now.

365
00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:10.380
Zeljko Ivezic: so again can you repeat the question, please. Oh, sorry! Again the question was, Why do we assume Gaussians for uncertainty when we calculate likelihood?

366
00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:23.820
Zeljko Ivezic: And the answer is here. We assume it for pedagogical reasons, and because Gaussian comes often in practice for various reasons that will go over in just few minutes. It's part of this lecture later.

367
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:25.540
Lovro: Thank you.

368
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:32.820
Zeljko Ivezic: So the next thing next concept is this goodness of fix. So when we look at this.

369
00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:33.890
Zeljko Ivezic: what

370
00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:44.570
Zeljko Ivezic: you can tell by all that the the, the, the, the green line is the best, and what we are thinking by this is the the nothing goes through the points.

371
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:59.480
Zeljko Ivezic: And so we want to measure this so obviously the quantity that counts is the difference between your data and model. and normalized by your Eric, but your uncertainties.

372
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:09.680
Zeljko Ivezic: And so, when you now add this for all the points. This now becomes identical to the so-called ties fair distribution.

373
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:15.150
Zeljko Ivezic: That's a well known theoretical distribution from statistics.

374
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:28.050
Zeljko Ivezic: And so we know that it will be distributed according to some formula, and from that formula we can predict that the expectation value is equal to N. Minus K. And this is uncertainty.

375
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:44.140
Zeljko Ivezic: And so when we do it in practice. In statistics we then normalize by this N. Minus K. This is so called the number of degrees of freedom which is equal to the number of data points, minus the number of 3 parameters.

376
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:51.990
Zeljko Ivezic: And so then we expect that the Kai's fair per degree of freedom, which is calculated from this formula

377
00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.830
Zeljko Ivezic: we expect that value to be about one.

378
00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:03.310
Zeljko Ivezic: and we expected to 38 from one

379
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.620
Zeljko Ivezic: by one, over

380
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.060
Zeljko Ivezic: by square root of 2 over

381
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:15.530
Zeljko Ivezic: 2 over N. Minus K. So basically you divide these 2 by and minus. K. So

382
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:21.140
Zeljko Ivezic: the most important thing to remember is that for a good fit. This number will be of the order one.

383
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:34.000
Zeljko Ivezic: In other words, when I look at my model, I expect, on average, that these points will deviate by one sigma by one a error bar. Sometimes they will be very close to model like this one.

384
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:38.230
Zeljko Ivezic: Sometimes they will deviate by more than one error bar.

385
00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:43.040
Zeljko Ivezic: but on average it will be about one error bar around the best fit model.

386
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.160
Zeljko Ivezic: If your model is

387
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:53.480
Zeljko Ivezic: good, if your model corresponds to the true model, and if your error and certainties really follow G. And distribution, then you are good.

388
00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:57.170
Zeljko Ivezic: now they are in cases. But this is not good.

389
00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:02.650
Zeljko Ivezic: and so these are examples, and often you can see them in science papers. When people

390
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:07.790
Zeljko Ivezic: do regression and show results, you can tell by I that they screw up something that something's wrong.

391
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:11.170
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you look at the top left panel.

392
00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:19.220
Zeljko Ivezic: it's an example of a constant function. So this straight line, but it's flat, so there is no dependence on. Why

393
00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:24.960
Zeljko Ivezic: act on x-axis? I'm sorry you can ignore that. And so you look at these points

394
00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:28.870
Zeljko Ivezic: and the scattered around that for his own telegraph.

395
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:35.960
Zeljko Ivezic: and when you compute the degree of freedom, you get point 96, so it's very close to one

396
00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:37.460
Zeljko Ivezic: where you would expect it.

397
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:43.040
Zeljko Ivezic: But now, if you look at the top right panel, something's fishy there.

398
00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:49.750
Zeljko Ivezic: Those points are not scattered enough. If you look at their

399
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:54.190
Zeljko Ivezic: you would expect much more scheduled, but they seem to be planned.

400
00:47:55.260 --> 00:48:02.360
Zeljko Ivezic: And so if you compute Chi-square physically, if you're going to get point 5 and 4, so we know immediately here

401
00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.930
Zeljko Ivezic: that these error uncertainties are overestimated.

402
00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:15.230
Zeljko Ivezic: So you would recognize in real data set. There is something wrong with your error estimates because you get too little scheduled

403
00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:21.680
Zeljko Ivezic: compared to what you expect from the On the other hand, the bottom left

404
00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:37.090
Zeljko Ivezic: is the opposite case where you underestimate your Eros, you either somehow computed them, but didn't include all the terms. But there are hidden error contributions to the know about, and when you now look at this, your Chi square is too large.

405
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:38.210
Zeljko Ivezic: It's about 4,

406
00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:44.770
Zeljko Ivezic: not one that immediately tells you that you do not understand your errors.

407
00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:52.370
Zeljko Ivezic: and finally, the bottom right panel is an example of that model there is obviously trend.

408
00:48:52.650 --> 00:49:10.170
Zeljko Ivezic: It goes from up to down, from left to right. but it's not included in the model. The model is pipeline, not slow of line, so that tells you that your model is not so. By looking at this goodness of fit, you can immediately see if your statistical assumptions in maximum likelihood approach

409
00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:16.590
Zeljko Ivezic: are valid. You cannot prove they are correct, but you can recognize when they are wrong.

410
00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:37.070
Zeljko Ivezic: All right. So then, now, going back to to your question, Why did we use Gaussian? Do we always have to use it? Indeed, we don't, and often, when people do not understand the uncertainties.

411
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:39.590
Zeljko Ivezic: they simply want to minimize this.

412
00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.480
Zeljko Ivezic: These

413
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:48.340
Zeljko Ivezic: mean, integrated square error, which is very similar to the long likelihood, except it's not

414
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.240
Zeljko Ivezic: normalized by a certainty

415
00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:56.210
Zeljko Ivezic: that comes mostly from computer scientists. So not really

416
00:49:56.220 --> 00:50:04.810
Zeljko Ivezic: STEM scientists in a sense of measuring nature. But they are just trying to describe some behavior, and often they are not

417
00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:14.290
Zeljko Ivezic: concern about the certainties Like, for example, if you wanted to predict what movie on Netflix you would like next.

418
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:16.980
Zeljko Ivezic: that basically minimizing this function.

419
00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:27.180
Zeljko Ivezic: which has many input variables, your past behavior, etc., etc. There you live what people around you like. So they are. The Sigma eyes

420
00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:32.450
Zeljko Ivezic: are not used to just minimize function like this. and in particular

421
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:37.970
Zeljko Ivezic: you don't even have to do this. Where? Why would I have to maximize the square?

422
00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:41.000
Zeljko Ivezic: Why, Don't, I maximize the

423
00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:56.550
Zeljko Ivezic: Of course it has to be symmetric, negative versus positive. So that's why it's period, but it could be also absolute value. There is no square, and indeed, that is the original method for fitting straight line to data points.

424
00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:04.080
Zeljko Ivezic: The first one who did it was actually original. Wash of it. That's piece of tree that that people often don't know

425
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:06.800
Zeljko Ivezic: popularizing around the world.

426
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:13.080
Zeljko Ivezic: So it was measuring the state of our planet of the earth.

427
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:16.320
Zeljko Ivezic: trying to find deviations from her experience.

428
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:26.920
Zeljko Ivezic: and at that time he didn't understand fully the concept of uncertainties and what probability distribution they would follow. But he knew that

429
00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:31.080
Zeljko Ivezic: he could have full values, but he would also have very large values.

430
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.300
Zeljko Ivezic: because sometimes measurement goes bad

431
00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:36.280
Zeljko Ivezic: or whatever. And so

432
00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:49.440
Zeljko Ivezic: he knew that it wasn't something like us Gaussian distribution didn't even exist at the time. It was before Dallas was born, but he knew intuitively that he had to allow probability of very large tariffs.

433
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:54.790
Zeljko Ivezic: and so in modern terminology. He was imagining exponential distribution

434
00:51:55.090 --> 00:52:00.630
Zeljko Ivezic: that when you put it in log one it has straight lines. And

435
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:08.540
Zeljko Ivezic: so Gaussian has 10 details. But the exponential of these 2 people who go very far out, and it can allow for.

436
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:11.690
Zeljko Ivezic: And so that's how he minimized

437
00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:21.040
Zeljko Ivezic: differences between model and his data, and this how to fit line today. The computer science, we call it L. One north.

438
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.380
Zeljko Ivezic: Another way to

439
00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:26.760
Zeljko Ivezic: modify this square function

440
00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:32.000
Zeljko Ivezic: which corresponds to Gaussian errors. It's just to add artificial turn.

441
00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.830
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is so called Kubernetes

442
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:48.090
Zeljko Ivezic: that Mr. Hoover introduced the computer science. And this is what most computer science is used when they have possibility of very large errors that compromise would be ruled out by the

443
00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:53.040
Zeljko Ivezic: So basically this in our curves that just for us.

444
00:52:53.140 --> 00:53:12.870
Zeljko Ivezic: that's what comes from Gaussian distribution. And now, if you assume that every now and then something goes bad, and you can have much larger errors, then you'll add the softening term, which is the linear function. Absolute value of T 30 is now relative deviation. But then you can choose

445
00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:18.920
Zeljko Ivezic: this coefficient to have different smoke, and the lounge for more and more. So it's complete.

446
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:35.660
Zeljko Ivezic: It's complete AD hoc method. It's cooking up some distribution. You don't really know that it happens in reality. But basically you want to allow for the possibility of super large errors. Another possibility would be to add 2 Gaussians

447
00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:48.730
Zeljko Ivezic: where one is narrow, that for response to well understood errors. And then you say, Every now and then we screw up something in the lab, and we get giant errors. We will model this with another Gaussian that has much wider

448
00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:49.620
Zeljko Ivezic: with.

449
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:52.520
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you try to minimize the problem.

450
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:59.990
Zeljko Ivezic: So it doesn't have to be Gaussian. And so you now also look at.

451
00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:06.050
Zeljko Ivezic: That's a totally non Gaussian behavioral distribution. So before I go there.

452
00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:08.870
Zeljko Ivezic: are you good? So far does it make any sense?

453
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:12.140
Okay.

454
00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:13.530
Zeljko Ivezic: of course.

455
00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:15.470
So

456
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:22.210
Zeljko Ivezic: So

457
00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:28.300
So okay.

458
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:35.310
Zeljko Ivezic: if that's what your measurement does. Hopefully. bye.

459
00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:42.590
Zeljko Ivezic: No, it's not. No, we will actually look at it.

460
00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:46.340
Zeljko Ivezic: If the number of data points is small.

461
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:53.810
Zeljko Ivezic: the clipping of the sales will not arrive to go to Gaussian, for example, if you only have 4 or 5 measurements.

462
00:54:53.890 --> 00:55:06.280
Zeljko Ivezic: and you ask that's new, Sigma case that it will return to you have 4 5 measurements. You cannot assume that your probability for me is now, and it's actually students t distribution.

463
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:15.580
Zeljko Ivezic: And normally. When n reaches of the order 10, you can show how it moves through that speed distribution. Morphs in the

464
00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.820
Zeljko Ivezic: correct correct

465
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:18.940
Zeljko Ivezic: exactly.

466
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.700
Zeljko Ivezic: and then we'll also last time. Actually, we talked little bit about

467
00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:31.920
Zeljko Ivezic: when central limit Theorem doesn't apply. When you have Koshi or Lorenzian distribution, it has such details that you can forget about Central.

468
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:43.070
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay. Here's one example from a. We have 10 galaxies, 4 of them like like 4. What is the fraction of galaxies with like host?

469
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:46.490
Zeljko Ivezic: Or what is the confidence region.

470
00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:48.550
Zeljko Ivezic: the most probable

471
00:55:48.770 --> 00:56:00.500
Zeljko Ivezic: 40%. But it's a small sample. So we need to understand what statistical distributions we can expect. There are many other incarnations of the same mathematical moment.

472
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:05.950
Zeljko Ivezic: One obviously is so, the flip calling, and

473
00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:13.910
Zeljko Ivezic: you would expect, if it's fair coin, that you get to find s and 5 sales, but then you can now to be 46.

474
00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:23.020
Zeljko Ivezic: Now the question is, is that statistical graduation, or am I cheating you with a unfair coin and trying to get your us.

475
00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:26.070
Zeljko Ivezic: or you can ask in the last

476
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:36.130
Zeljko Ivezic: search for 10 young scientists at which are both Bridge Institute, they fired 7 webin and 3 men is root your biased against me

477
00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.970
Zeljko Ivezic: in you.

478
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:48.400
Zeljko Ivezic: But in Croatia, proudly, we are one of the second or third country in EU in the fraction of

479
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:52.180
Zeljko Ivezic: it's more than 50%. So you could ask this question.

480
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:56.380
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you now had 1 million people hired.

481
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:57.690
Zeljko Ivezic: and

482
00:56:57.770 --> 00:57:03.570
Zeljko Ivezic: you only find that 300,000 men you would have very strong case. Obviously there is bias.

483
00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:10.500
Zeljko Ivezic: but if you have small sample, then it's not. Obviously whether it's biased or not. So it is good to know how to solve this problem.

484
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:28.110
Zeljko Ivezic: They actually often look at the code that you've seen couple of pages when I read newspapers very, very often, maybe once a month. There is example of this statistical problem in newspapers when they talk about something, and usually they derive all conclusion. They claim something when statistically it's.

485
00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.660
Zeljko Ivezic: Yes, oh.

486
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:31.520
Zeljko Ivezic: all right.

487
00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:37.150
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is the who likelihood for the process where

488
00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:42.570
Zeljko Ivezic: you draw, measure something, and the outcome is only 0, or one.

489
00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:46.180
Zeljko Ivezic: say, or success, or whatever you want.

490
00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:55.720
Zeljko Ivezic: mainly female. Whatever has 2 possible states is described by this binomial process, so n is the total number of draws.

491
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:01.830
Zeljko Ivezic: and then K is the number of rows that are considered to be success, that heaven

492
00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:09.400
Zeljko Ivezic: that are one, and then 0 is the opposite case, and B is the intrinsic probability of success.

493
00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:17.310
Zeljko Ivezic: which for coin fairly point, would be point 5. If If it's crooked point, it would be point 9 One. That's it.

494
00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.400
Zeljko Ivezic: And so then you can again

495
00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:40.130
Zeljko Ivezic: assume that this number so large you can take. Derivative You can get Gaussian approximation which tells you. Obviously that just K. Over N. Is your best expected value. B. And by second, derivative. You can get this uncertainty that's approximately solution that works when N. Is huge

496
00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:48.490
Zeljko Ivezic: when N is not huge, then we actually have to maximize this likelihood without approximations. And so this piece of code.

497
00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:50.810
Zeljko Ivezic: thanks

498
00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:58.180
Zeljko Ivezic: and total number of experiments. The same is capital, and about it takes number of successes, so you can tell it.

499
00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:02.360
Zeljko Ivezic: I slipped, going 10 times. I got 4

500
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:12.400
Zeljko Ivezic: heads. Is that going cricket. and then for plotting purposes, there is this auxiliary variable that says, what is the limit for the plot of cumulative distribution function?

501
00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:15.130
Zeljko Ivezic: So then, given

502
00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.280
Zeljko Ivezic: this data, I generate Grid. Of

503
00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:25.500
Zeljko Ivezic: that B is the probability of success. Point 5 for fair coin, or whatever between 0 and one.

504
00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:38.880
Zeljko Ivezic: Then I take this probability, according to to the binomial distribution, and I also then plot cumulative distribution function, which is the sum of that probability.

505
00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.810
Zeljko Ivezic: I also add.

506
00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:46.610
Zeljko Ivezic: for pedagogical reasons and Gaussian approximation, and then I plot this.

507
00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:57.180
Zeljko Ivezic: and so this is the result. So then, I can call this for any N. And K. So first, 10 and 4 as we started. discuss it.

508
00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:04.500
Zeljko Ivezic: So on the left side you can see now the probability or the likelihood of where you'd be.

509
01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.530
Zeljko Ivezic: because I have 4 of them

510
01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:11.470
Zeljko Ivezic: the highest P. For why you? This is for over 10. It is point 4,

511
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:26.260
Zeljko Ivezic: but the more interesting quantity is the beta that move on. So you can see. Now, if you put limit a few percent in details. you can't really reject anything between like point, 1.15 on the way point 8 or so.

512
01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:33.510
Zeljko Ivezic: It's all good. so I can't claim that this point is good.

513
01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:42.430
Zeljko Ivezic: right. Spanish is exactly the same data, except now it's full. Take out of the function on the last from minus infinity to the second value.

514
01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:44.420
Zeljko Ivezic: and the for it is on top.

515
01:00:44.890 --> 01:00:51.900
Zeljko Ivezic: One shows probability cumulative of point 5. So that's medium. So that breaks

516
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:59.760
Zeljko Ivezic: sampling to haunts, and in particular, if i'm interested, say, in rejecting at 1%

517
01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:07.420
Zeljko Ivezic: confidence this value. So this is one I would hear read of point 15 or so

518
01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:13.680
Zeljko Ivezic: so at that level of confidence. I cannot reject values as low as this point.

519
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.280
Zeljko Ivezic: even though the the

520
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:18.200
what.

521
01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:26.880
Zeljko Ivezic: and then the which is kind of okay.

522
01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:45.690
Zeljko Ivezic: If you're looking at extreme values, and you want to say, I want to be certain that If, for example, the lesson point is something bad, I want to be certain that they're backing will not happen. Then. Using out of that formation give you very so. The blue is the choice.

523
01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:50.790
Zeljko Ivezic: Now, if you change 10 and 4 to 2 and one. Now you can see what happens.

524
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:55.490
Zeljko Ivezic: So we are centered on Point 5.

525
01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:09.500
Zeljko Ivezic: You flip 20 points back one scale. But look at that bit of that distribution. You can go to these extreme values, and there are still a lot You cannot play.

526
01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:16.100
Zeljko Ivezic: Not only that you cannot claim that the point is fair. We cannot reject possibility that it's badly.

527
01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:17.370
Zeljko Ivezic: Why.

528
01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.070
Zeljko Ivezic: now, if you have larger sample.

529
01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:26.250
Zeljko Ivezic: Then things approved this, this example of one out of 10.

530
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:33.860
Zeljko Ivezic: So what can I tell about calling one out of 10, or what do they tell about some institution.

531
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.630
Zeljko Ivezic: Hi! Everyone!

532
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.540
Zeljko Ivezic: Oh, that is one of those kind.

533
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:43.740
Zeljko Ivezic: Let's say we want to be unbiased.

534
01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:48.470
Zeljko Ivezic: so we would expect 5 out of that

535
01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.740
Zeljko Ivezic: is it usually.

536
01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:57.640
Zeljko Ivezic: But now you find it with one content. Would you be

537
01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:08.920
Zeljko Ivezic: so? This gives you now a physical answer to this. If you look at B of Point 5. There is still probability there, and it's even better seen on the right panel.

538
01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:28.010
Zeljko Ivezic: Maybe not. I should re plot. So this blue line here is not exactly a one that, like few percent probability, there you are, one of it. So even we just want to understand. You do not have super strong case that you're

539
01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.710
Zeljko Ivezic: so you. This is the beginning of the beginning

540
01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:37.530
Zeljko Ivezic: beginning to become interesting when you have one out. If it was fine.

541
01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:42.380
Zeljko Ivezic: 2 out of 10. Then it would be even weaker case, and we can easily do that

542
01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.350
Zeljko Ivezic: if I change this to 2

543
01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:59.260
Zeljko Ivezic: should have plotted horizontal line. But you can. Now, if you imagine horizontal line in here at Point 5. Now, I cannot reject it at 1% level at all.

544
01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:06.130
Zeljko Ivezic: Or if I only had, like I don't know 5 and one which gives me the same ratio

545
01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:18.160
Zeljko Ivezic: then. I have even weaker case in point 5. Now I cannot even reject at 5%. So when one makes accusations of bias with small samples.

546
01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:24.680
Zeljko Ivezic: you need to look at this call and compute proper posterior proper likelihood, it's very easy to be misled.

547
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:29.380
Zeljko Ivezic: Questions about this part.

548
01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:37.720
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay, then, let me do the last topic for today.

549
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.010
Zeljko Ivezic: Sometimes

550
01:04:40.830 --> 01:04:43.970
Zeljko Ivezic: the

551
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.750
Zeljko Ivezic: it's miserable.

552
01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:51.100
Zeljko Ivezic: and this is one example of where it just doesn't make sense.

553
01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:56.420
Zeljko Ivezic: despite all these beautiful properties that it has it doesn't make sense.

554
01:04:57.310 --> 01:05:01.400
Zeljko Ivezic: So let's say you wait for a bus, you

555
01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:13.300
Zeljko Ivezic: when it is to some touristy place increase that they have never been. You have no idea how often the bus is going. but you do know that they go.

556
01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:21.390
Zeljko Ivezic: Everything else is on time, you So this is

557
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:28.260
Zeljko Ivezic: so. We had a place where buses go regularly every 12Â min.

558
01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.530
Zeljko Ivezic: and you come to Bus station.

559
01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:35.140
Zeljko Ivezic: and you wait for 10Â min. Let's say 10Â min

560
01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:38.440
Zeljko Ivezic: t equals 10 and bus arrives.

561
01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:43.960
Zeljko Ivezic: What is your best estimate now? Of how?

562
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:48.410
Zeljko Ivezic: What do you know about time. If you wait for 10Â min.

563
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.770
Zeljko Ivezic: what is the All right?

564
01:05:55.330 --> 01:06:01.610
Zeljko Ivezic: So it's.

565
01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:15.090
Zeljko Ivezic: But would it be larger than that? Of course it could, because we did not care about the bus station at the exact point of the previous bus. There was some bus before you arrived.

566
01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.630
Zeljko Ivezic: and you have no idea when they

567
01:06:19.310 --> 01:06:28.180
Zeljko Ivezic: so you would say, Well. I know. and then it would be all the way to infinity. Right?

568
01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:43.350
Zeljko Ivezic: You cannot reject that possibility, but you know of that distribution for town. Let's say bus comes at this hour. This is time

569
01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:50.970
Zeljko Ivezic: Bus came here, and next one is there, and somewhere in between.

570
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:54.370
Zeljko Ivezic: on average. When would you expect it to?

571
01:06:56.810 --> 01:07:12.910
Zeljko Ivezic: Sometimes a little bit below half of interval, Sometimes, after half the interval when I have it to go, I would arrive exactly in have been by the reason of symmetry. I know I would arrive exactly in the middle of that interval

572
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:14.570
Zeljko Ivezic: of the length to.

573
01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:24.300
Zeljko Ivezic: but I know that I waited for 2Â min, so the whole interval has to be 2 times that. So, my maximum likelihood Estimator.

574
01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:33.790
Zeljko Ivezic: Not much. I'm sorry I in this book, not Microsoft's estimator. Common sense estimator is that town is twice as long as I.

575
01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:41.500
Zeljko Ivezic: That's what I would expect. The problem is when I apply maximum likelihood methods I get from your results.

576
01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:48.210
Zeljko Ivezic: So when we they apply

577
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:52.890
Zeljko Ivezic: this assumption of uniform distribution. then

578
01:07:53.440 --> 01:08:05.490
Zeljko Ivezic: probability of T. How long will I wait given? How is anywhere in that interval it has to integrate to one. So where your probabilities one over Tau times, tau

579
01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.370
Zeljko Ivezic: the week of the interval that gives me one.

580
01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.400
Zeljko Ivezic: and I know that

581
01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:21.130
Zeljko Ivezic: t must be less or equal to, or tower greater than T. And so the maximum, then, of course, is at Tau equals t

582
01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:31.390
Zeljko Ivezic: not at 2 T. I'm off by factor of 2. And whatever I do to this maximum likelihood approach, I can't make it work.

583
01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:46.000
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's bad because it's not. It's not something so that it is pure mark. And yes, I get nonsense results. Common sense tells me my best estimate of.

584
01:08:46.029 --> 01:08:58.920
Zeljko Ivezic: and maximum lighting it with me. It's one thing. How do I res always? That's very frustrating. And it was frustrating statisticians for quite some time.

585
01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:05.880
Zeljko Ivezic: and they realized that in the advent of Bayesian statistics, where you actually have a price for your parameters

586
01:09:05.899 --> 01:09:18.390
Zeljko Ivezic: that's multiplying likelihood to get posterior capability. This was a nice, simple, neat example of that need for prior, for your free parameters

587
01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:24.990
Zeljko Ivezic: provide range of the parameter as well as if you have some knowledge of how it should vary.

588
01:09:25.069 --> 01:09:31.740
Zeljko Ivezic: And so when we meet next time we will go through this thought process for bias and statistics in much.

589
01:09:31.939 --> 01:09:34.220
Zeljko Ivezic: much more slow way.

590
01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:49.340
Zeljko Ivezic: I just want to to quickly show the conundrum the resolution of this conundrum here. Next time we learn that we use base rule to right posterior, it's not just maximum likelihood it has to be mounted by Prior.

591
01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:54.260
Zeljko Ivezic: We often implicitly assume that prior is flat

592
01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:55.520
Zeljko Ivezic: constant.

593
01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:08.480
Zeljko Ivezic: and then it doesn't matter whether you multiply by not, when you maximize likelihood, and in great majority of cases you get numerically the same result as you would from maximum likelihood method alone.

594
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:12.200
Zeljko Ivezic: But sometimes you really need the prior, and that was the case.

595
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:30.070
Zeljko Ivezic: And in particular we'll learn the princip of of minimum information or maximum entropy for setting briers next time, and then we will see why we need to put Prior. That is one over town in this problem. I'm not going to explain why in this lecture, but the next one.

596
01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:34.700
Zeljko Ivezic: But the answer to the conundrum is, if we need to multiply by one over the

597
01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:47.050
Zeljko Ivezic: and then this integral is not divergent anymore. Now it's conversion. And now, when I do expectation value, I get that best estimate of power is 2 T, which is correct result.

598
01:10:52.150 --> 01:10:56.680
Zeljko Ivezic: And so, then there are some cases where you cannot

599
01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.800
Zeljko Ivezic: right Likely

600
01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:07.860
Zeljko Ivezic: one example is from astronomy, that, for example, we have distribution of galaxies on this kind, which are like single points.

601
01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:12.050
Zeljko Ivezic: and we cannot calculate likelihood

602
01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:21.680
Zeljko Ivezic: that galaxy is a specific point from this kind. It's totally random, and we don't know what's causing it. What we know is just this distribution of points.

603
01:11:21.970 --> 01:11:35.850
Zeljko Ivezic: So we do have some knowledge about that process. For example, when you look at the distribution, you see it's not random, it's not like if you took cancel of sand and through on table on the desk. And you look at this distribution. There is very particular structure.

604
01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:51.160
Zeljko Ivezic: but it's it's not possible to write like that. However, you can derive statistical measures like. For example, you can ask, what is the distribution of distances between 2 nearest analysis, so called 2.

605
01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:59.730
Zeljko Ivezic: It's basically statistical procedure that you know. And then you can run simulations of galaxies. and you can measure it from your simulations.

606
01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:10.810
Zeljko Ivezic: And so you cannot predict where galaxies are, but you can predict the statistical behavior. And so then you go through the model parameter space.

607
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:13.370
Zeljko Ivezic: And basically you search

608
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:27.240
Zeljko Ivezic: for all the regions in can be very highly multi-dimensional model parameters space. You search it until that's statistic, whatever you is designed this case 2.4 away from that begins to look the same like the data.

609
01:12:27.730 --> 01:12:39.500
Zeljko Ivezic: So you are not really maximizing likelihood. but you are minimizing differences between some appropriate which choose and statistic it depends on.

610
01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:49.090
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's called approximate by his conversation, ABC. And you can find it in in in this link.

611
01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:59.170
Zeljko Ivezic: So we will not go when we introduce by using a statistic we'll ignore the difficulty, but it is possible to work without likelihood, even in the context.

612
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:10.290
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay, good. So I was afraid I would not get to the end of this lecture today, because there is lots of stuff that we covered.

613
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:13.670
Zeljko Ivezic: but V. 8. So what did we learn today.

614
01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.990
Zeljko Ivezic: So we introduce likelihood function.

615
01:13:17.410 --> 01:13:33.860
Zeljko Ivezic: which is important both in classical statistics, so called frequency statistic. It shows, for example, the origin of those many expressions that we learn in that to relapse like, for example, weighted some. Why do we combine measurements

616
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:38.490
Zeljko Ivezic: by taking weights that are equal to one over Sigma 3?

617
01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:43.200
Zeljko Ivezic: Now we can demonstrate this. Maxwell, like a good approach.

618
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:50.210
Zeljko Ivezic: and by assuming it's Gaussian uncertainty for your measurements. Then you justify why you

619
01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:54.550
Zeljko Ivezic: how many measurements with those weights. We also

620
01:13:54.690 --> 01:14:00.570
Zeljko Ivezic: showed how to fit how to regress different content again using the same approach.

621
01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:08.290
Zeljko Ivezic: And that function that approach the likelihood approach will be crucial ingredients for the next time.

622
01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:23.050
Zeljko Ivezic: So next time you'll introduce the concept of a Asian statistics basically the statements that the actual posterior probability distribution for your model parameters. It's not just likelihood you don't maximize just likelihood

623
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:25.700
Zeljko Ivezic: you have to.

624
01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:32.800
Zeljko Ivezic: and that resource some conundrums like this example, with waiting for bus. But it also

625
01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:45.660
Zeljko Ivezic: it allows you to do lots of other things in the analysis, like, for example, combining prior and knowledge with your current measurements. or you can combine the previous measurements

626
01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:47.780
Zeljko Ivezic: with new measurements.

627
01:14:47.800 --> 01:15:01.510
Zeljko Ivezic: You can do so-called Peter at the online algorithms. It also will allow you to solve this problem. Of When do I start fitting polynomials. Remember, we get 22 points, and then we can see if any of you.

628
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:03.410
Zeljko Ivezic: How do I know

629
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:11.020
Zeljko Ivezic: that i'm going to too complicated? They model that will also come from by as an approach that we can actually define

630
01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:24.220
Zeljko Ivezic: the probability of a model. We can have different models and compute which model is the most probable. and we will automatically get what's called what comes razor. I don't know if you ever heard of it.

631
01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:32.340
Zeljko Ivezic: I was surprised how late. I learned about it somehow. I managed to go through my education here, and then never heard of. All comes Frazer until I went to.

632
01:15:32.890 --> 01:15:34.200
Zeljko Ivezic: But maybe you are like some of this.

633
01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:43.380
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's the principle that you should take the simplest model out of all the models that still fits the data.

634
01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:55.710
Zeljko Ivezic: So you don't want to over complicated things. You have to explain the data, but you have to do it with the simplest possible one. and that that was stated like 800 years ago by

635
01:15:55.850 --> 01:16:02.810
Zeljko Ivezic: by in England. But today we have actual mathematical framework

636
01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:12.670
Zeljko Ivezic: that automatically we produce the results, and even will give us explicit formula for how to choose the best model of all the possible models that we saw today.

637
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:15.770
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is the last building block.

638
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:30.800
Zeljko Ivezic: Well, by using statistics. So next time we will introduce by using a statistic, and if we went through anything that doesn't make full sense, please do take a look at the many steps that I've schemed over. Take a look before the next time.

639
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:34.690
Zeljko Ivezic: So thank you. That's it for today, except for practice.

640
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:42.850
Zeljko Ivezic: So there is something in that good good point.

641
01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.150
Zeljko Ivezic: No, they are not questions. They were problems with audio.

642
01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.170
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay, I think that's it for today, unless you have questions.

643
01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:58.820
Zeljko Ivezic: Yes.

644
01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:02.210
okay.

645
01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:04.220
Okay.

646
01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.870
Zeljko Ivezic: if you ask the same question.

647
01:17:16.150 --> 01:17:21.000
Zeljko Ivezic: then you can.

648
01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:22.890
Okay. hey?

649
01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:35.040
Zeljko Ivezic: You could. But usually what we do in science. It's not the question that. So this business with confidence, interval versus credibility region.

650
01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:38.630
Zeljko Ivezic: In classical statistics we say.

651
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.710
Zeljko Ivezic: we will now estimate this confidence in current, and now imagine

652
01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:48.540
Zeljko Ivezic: that you have large number of identical experience

653
01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:58.070
Zeljko Ivezic: what you can that, and if it's what minus one, c. One that's in 68 of those ipothetical

654
01:17:58.260 --> 01:17:59.520
Zeljko Ivezic: experiments.

655
01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:04.280
Zeljko Ivezic: the true value of meal would land.

656
01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:09.130
Zeljko Ivezic: You can make it.

657
01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:12.540
Zeljko Ivezic: You can show that it works. Basically

658
01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:19.040
Zeljko Ivezic: you do it repeated like like your experiments could be us drawing a Gaussian sample.

659
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:29.180
Zeljko Ivezic: So we say, let's for the sake of simulation. The zoom new is 100, and we have 100 points or whatever I you know, a random sample in my, not

660
01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:32.320
Zeljko Ivezic: I estimate my

661
01:18:32.610 --> 01:18:36.060
Zeljko Ivezic: and then I do it again 100 times. The

662
01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:44.000
Zeljko Ivezic: that in 68 of these experiments what they call a confidence interval actually would contain the true new

663
01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:44.910
Zeljko Ivezic: 100,

664
01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:56.140
Zeljko Ivezic: and you do it. But the problem is that in practice in science it's not the question we are asking. i'm not going to

665
01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:00.460
Zeljko Ivezic: what i'm asking in science is I measured something

666
01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:08.340
Zeljko Ivezic: that's my single dataset, and the question i'm asking is, what is the inter

667
01:19:08.730 --> 01:19:15.710
Zeljko Ivezic: for me? For example, this gives me 68% capability. That new is in that.

668
01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:24.930
Zeljko Ivezic: So the posterior probability of a model parameter that is a concept that doesn't exist in treatment

669
01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:32.490
Zeljko Ivezic: because there is no concept of

670
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:43.460
Zeljko Ivezic: model parameter. This guy even got known only to God, and we only can go around in by Asia. Statistic model parameter itself follows a probability

671
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:46.270
Zeljko Ivezic: because our knowledge of it

672
01:19:46.570 --> 01:19:56.050
Zeljko Ivezic: it's never perfect. because we never have perfect measurements or infinitely large sand. so you can never have perfect knowledge that was put

673
01:19:56.100 --> 01:20:00.880
Zeljko Ivezic: this parameter posterior parameter distribution on the

674
01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:09.910
Zeljko Ivezic: in theory, even in Bayesian statistic. If I had anything large sample, then my model parameter would be Delta function. It would be perfectly No.

675
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:13.060
Zeljko Ivezic: But it's only a consequence of

676
01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:15.020
Zeljko Ivezic: in classical statistics.

677
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.600
Zeljko Ivezic: model parameters and memory distributions. They are numbers given

678
01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:21.730
Zeljko Ivezic: like.

679
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:25.330
Zeljko Ivezic: Yeah, by using this one.

680
01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:28.720
Zeljko Ivezic: Are there more questions?

681
01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.240
Zeljko Ivezic: Well, then, thank you again for coming today, and i'll see you on Thursday.

682
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:38.110
Zeljko Ivezic: It was

683
01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:49.750
Zeljko Ivezic: friends on zoom. We are done for today. I'm going to log off. Thanks for coming.

684
01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:52.180
Lovro: Thanks, Bye, bye.
