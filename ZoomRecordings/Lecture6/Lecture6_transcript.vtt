1
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.570
Zeljko Ivezic: Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.120
Zeljko Ivezic: Can. You confirm you can hear me. I'm having difficulties here.

3
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.840
Zeljko Ivezic: Oh, okay, thanks.

4
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.459
Zeljko Ivezic: So congratulations to the last lecture of the first serious.

5
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:27.799
Zeljko Ivezic: So before I forget the second part of this series, the next 6 lectures will be starting, probably in mid January of the next year.

6
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.819
Zeljko Ivezic: Now. I don't know yet when exactly, but I will know by October.

7
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:44.930
Zeljko Ivezic: and then I will send email again to everyone who was signed up for the first serious. I will send an email about exact timing of those 6 lectures.

8
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.470
Zeljko Ivezic: Much

9
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.320
Zeljko Ivezic: good.

10
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.130
Zeljko Ivezic: Sorry about disruptions.

11
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.830
Zeljko Ivezic: I presume everyone is okay with being recorded.

12
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:22.330
Zeljko Ivezic: It will eventually be a documentary movie about. So you might see yourself one day

13
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.880
Zeljko Ivezic: in a movie.

14
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:36.850
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you recall, last lecture was about using Markov chain, Monte Carlo rentals to do Bayesian statistics, and by that we mean.

15
00:02:37.050 --> 00:03:05.620
Zeljko Ivezic: do regression get the best with model parameters, and also, if you have multiple models, you can compare them against each other. They are easy way to do it easy ways. One of them is so with polynomials, when we simply calculated guys square, and we calculated penalty and computed by Asia and information criterion, and that told us which order of the polynomial was the most justified statistically.

16
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:13.069
Zeljko Ivezic: Now, in that case it was easy, and we could compute price. We are because we assume Gaussian errors, but in general

17
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:34.009
Zeljko Ivezic: you will have sometimes known Gaussian errors. Sometimes you do not have enough data to approach Gaussian approximation at the end for the free parameters. So often when you do real research, when you have your real data set. Often you cannot get away with approximations and analytic methods.

18
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.470
Zeljko Ivezic: Often you do need to have a real workforce, real M. Cmc code to do that.

19
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.549
Zeljko Ivezic: So last time we used Pi and C 3

20
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:54.079
Zeljko Ivezic: code to do regression. And today we are going to focus little bit more on model selection.

21
00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:02.630
Zeljko Ivezic: And also we will use a different tool, just so that you have at least 2 different ways of doing it. So Pi and C 3

22
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.830
Zeljko Ivezic: is

23
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:18.729
Zeljko Ivezic: more powerful than Emc. But Emc is much easier to install and much easier to use. It's much simpler. So in particular, in astronomy, almost every man uses Cmc. Because it was developed by an astronomer, then Forum and Mickey

24
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.470
Zeljko Ivezic: it's called M. Cmc. Hammer. Have you ever heard for a

25
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.010
Zeljko Ivezic: Mc. Hammer, the rapper?

26
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.460
Zeljko Ivezic: No.

27
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.320
Okay.

28
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.510
Zeljko Ivezic: So then, for him on my key. Name the code after this guy.

29
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.070
Zeljko Ivezic: It's very easy to install it pure python, so you can simply say, Keep install, and see, and you have it on your computer.

30
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.539
Zeljko Ivezic: I hope you tried before the lecture, if not right later, and try to run the full lecture.

31
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:13.860
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is what we want to do. This is just recap. You saw this in Lecture 4. We can compare the 2 models by evaluating

32
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:26.590
Zeljko Ivezic: the ratio of their global likelihoods. And the bottom line, does it say, yes. B, 2 to one. That's the ratio of the global likelihood for 2 models that we will consider later. This is a general statement.

33
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:37.999
Zeljko Ivezic: So again, what is global likelihood, it's an integral over the allowed parameter space products of the likelihood. And prior for your model parameters.

34
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:44.990
Zeljko Ivezic: So we can do that analytically, like we did for Gaussian and for she distributions

35
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.220
Zeljko Ivezic: in lecture that we get 5 or 4

36
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.039
Zeljko Ivezic: today, we are going to do a slightly more complicated problem

37
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.919
Zeljko Ivezic: that is similar to say what physicists did when they were discovering picks.

38
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:05.459
Zeljko Ivezic: Let me first show you a picture. So this is motivation. It's simulated data so that we can see what we have.

39
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.220
Zeljko Ivezic: So these data points are generated from that great line.

40
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:18.859
Zeljko Ivezic: and the red line has 2 peaks in the background. So in this particular case.

41
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:32.299
Zeljko Ivezic: these 2 peaks are exponential functions because it was motivated by astronomy by explosions and stars that Mdk. Exponentially. But it could be more symmetric like a Gaussian. If you're working with elementary particle physics.

42
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:43.480
Zeljko Ivezic: it could be Gaussian. If you are working in chemistry, biology, biochemistry. Then we have samples, and then you have signal for something. So it could be anything. Basically, there is

43
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:51.579
Zeljko Ivezic: some structure in your data. And in but this particular case we assume that we know the model shape.

44
00:06:51.690 --> 00:07:01.040
Zeljko Ivezic: but we don't know where this speaks are, how wide they are, and we'll see here. We'll assume that we don't even know how many we have.

45
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:08.339
Zeljko Ivezic: So you are given this data, this data points again, that generated from this red line. And then noise is added.

46
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:19.980
Zeljko Ivezic: and those are error parts. So now I assume there is no red line. You don't know what is red line. You only have data points, and you want to ask question, do I have one or 2 Ps. Or more?

47
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.409
Zeljko Ivezic: So now we'll go slowly through this example.

48
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:38.090
Zeljko Ivezic: So there's the formula that describes why there's this X in this particular example, X is T. It's time. And why is flux from some star? But again, it's just mountains general example.

49
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:48.339
Zeljko Ivezic: And so we want to find out how many bursts of that form we have. So you can see that 2 free parameters there is a which measures amplitude.

50
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:59.150
Zeljko Ivezic: and there is out which measures how fast it the case. And so then we will assume that we have either one or 2.

51
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:16.379
Zeljko Ivezic: We could totally generalize this, we could even do vector vector implementation, like we did with polynomials for it, just say, number of firsts. But just for pedagogical reasons. These 2 are explicitly coded out, so that you can see difference between one and 2 first.

52
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.110
Zeljko Ivezic: And so you can see that in these 2 functions

53
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:42.230
Zeljko Ivezic: we are calling Np. Exponential function. Now, if you had Gaussian, it would just be place it here with some other Gaussian, and you're good to go with any other, for so these 2 functions now can calculate that red line in particular, if they are 2 peaks like in the picture I showed you, then you are using 2 bursts. You just call it on some grid of T, and you give it 3 parameters.

54
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.369
Zeljko Ivezic: So in one, in one case we have 3 free parameters plus background is 4.

55
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:59.240
Zeljko Ivezic: If we have 2 births, we end up with 7, 3 parameters, and it's a nonlinear function, meaning that if I take derivative of that function. With respect to Alpha.

56
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:05.839
Zeljko Ivezic: then Alpha does not vanish. It's nonlinear function. And it's very hard then to solve it

57
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:13.530
Zeljko Ivezic: analytically. And we need to use numerics. Okay? So now we choose some parameters in this block.

58
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:20.919
Zeljko Ivezic: Hopefully, later, you'll play with this and you'll change these numbers and then try to break the code, etc.

59
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:29.999
Zeljko Ivezic: The best way to learn about the code is to break it and then fix it. So then we generate the let's have 200 data points.

60
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:44.759
Zeljko Ivezic: And beyond well, we tend a bit. T up to 120. You generate randomly. It's not a great, it's random. It's selected 200 points. And then why, true is what I'm putting in the model. That's that red line.

61
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:54.290
Zeljko Ivezic: And then I also record myself the free parameters for later that the truth when I compare to what I get from.

62
00:09:54.610 --> 00:10:13.619
Zeljko Ivezic: And now I have some beard function for errors. I could have said point 4, and every data point would have the same error. I wanted little bit of variation, so that it's so called heeteros fantastic problem where each data point has different uncertainty. So it's square root of y 2.

63
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:24.720
Zeljko Ivezic: That's again motivated by astronomy, where our flux measurement error depends on the brightness of the star. And it goes this. These are mathematical details that are not fundamental.

64
00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:35.149
Zeljko Ivezic: And then we add, see this call, Y data equals Np random, normally normal through. And why error? I simply add.

65
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.060
Zeljko Ivezic: not at sorry. I simply

66
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:48.400
Zeljko Ivezic: generate something from a Gaussian with Sigma Y error. And then I added to to data, that's my data, and that's what's plotted in here now, we already saw this picture.

67
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.810
Zeljko Ivezic: So it's

68
00:10:52.010 --> 00:11:02.560
Zeljko Ivezic: just There is no calculation in here. This is just to illustrate what we generated. You always want to make sure that what you generated with your simulations that actually looks like what you expect.

69
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:07.930
Zeljko Ivezic: So it looks like a problem in one to hand. And so now we assume

70
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:17.629
Zeljko Ivezic: we have data points, those black points. Let's find out where those peaks are, and let's find out if they have one or 2.

71
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:26.170
Zeljko Ivezic: And so this is now where we define some function by a Z and context.

72
00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.280
Zeljko Ivezic: So now

73
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:34.890
Zeljko Ivezic: we have 2 models. I call them single and double that 2 functions.

74
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:41.689
Zeljko Ivezic: They take 3 parameters, and I'm calling them I'm calling. One burst into bursts.

75
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:50.399
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's the only place we are. I'm telling you anything about my functions. So if you want it now to change this code

76
00:11:50.470 --> 00:12:04.469
Zeljko Ivezic: and use Gauss, for example, you would go to one person 2. First, you would change the exponential function for Gaussian there, and you're good to go. Actually, when I teach this in a regular class, that's homework. After this lecture to do this code, but with Gaussian

77
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:13.740
Zeljko Ivezic: the I was seeing Peaks. and so now I define my true model as my model, and I decided to have

78
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.910
Zeljko Ivezic: 22 pigs.

79
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:21.950
Zeljko Ivezic: And now the following is just for essentially for

80
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:39.260
Zeljko Ivezic: avoiding overflow on some unix machines, and also for making pre tier figures with some tools. So this is not fundamental either. It's a nice thing that in python you can have infinity like in Fourth run, you cannot have infinity because it's computer. But Icon is intelligent enough to

81
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.820
Zeljko Ivezic: to decod it.

82
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:47.399
Zeljko Ivezic: And this is now the key. So this is where we now apply by Asian statistics this few months.

83
00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:53.839
Zeljko Ivezic: So we need to. So let's go from the bottom to the top. So log posterior.

84
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:59.800
Zeljko Ivezic: That is a function that we will give to. And Cmc. And ask

85
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.020
Zeljko Ivezic: to get back chains of numbers

86
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:10.990
Zeljko Ivezic: whose distribution, probability, distribution, and that multi-parameter space follows this function.

87
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:16.020
Zeljko Ivezic: That's the key of M Cmc. I give you a multi-dimensional function.

88
00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:24.460
Zeljko Ivezic: and M. Cmc. Returns a long chain of numbers that are drawn from that distribution. That's all. What time. Cmc does.

89
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:29.219
Zeljko Ivezic: Again, the recall that we mentioned Leveinberg market method.

90
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:41.029
Zeljko Ivezic: That is the most popular method for finding maximum of some function. That's, for example, super famous because it's in numerical recipes. That's amazing book with all the code.

91
00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:53.130
Zeljko Ivezic: Now, when you run 11 back, Markcard, you'll do find where is the optimal point. But you don't know how you got there again. That's a knowledge without an admin, and it's a

92
00:13:53.790 --> 00:14:00.609
Zeljko Ivezic: lemon. But Markcart will tell you very slamming. It's a location, but we'll tell you nothing of the shape of magic itself.

93
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:12.890
Zeljko Ivezic: while M. Cmc. They'll give you the full outline of the whole mountain, and then you can look at distribution in one calling and the other one correlations for variances, etc. That's the key of.

94
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:27.819
Zeljko Ivezic: So this little block now tells you how to implement it in so log posterior. So it's easier to work with what happens when you work with computers, because those numbers are huge. So automatically they switch to logarithms.

95
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:34.559
Zeljko Ivezic: And then, of course, the product of prior and likelihood becomes the son of 2 log

96
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:43.220
Zeljko Ivezic: lots of prior and log of likelihood. And that's exactly what happens in here. I define 2 functions like likelihood, and what prior

97
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:50.540
Zeljko Ivezic: I multiply them, we are doing Bayesian statistics, and they return their product or some of logs as possible.

98
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:55.420
Zeljko Ivezic: That is the recipe for M. Cmc. Code to evaluate the stereo.

99
00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.919
Zeljko Ivezic: Now, what do we put for likelihood

100
00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.190
Zeljko Ivezic: here? Load likelihood? Has this

101
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:06.940
Zeljko Ivezic: beta minus model divided by error, squared expression.

102
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:21.149
Zeljko Ivezic: And again, remember, this expression by itself assumes that your uncertainties in measurement are following Gaussian distribution. That's why this formula comes in. It's law or Gaussian, but it will be something else

103
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:34.680
Zeljko Ivezic: would be maybe exponential distribution. I think I mentioned to you that actually solving exponential distribution is older than solving for Gaussian errors, and that was first done by Richard Bosh for it many centuries ago.

104
00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:43.269
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is where we put this assumption about Gaussian errors, and the last thing we need to specify is prior for those model parameters.

105
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:47.550
Zeljko Ivezic: And so here for simplicity, we just take flat prior.

106
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:57.050
Zeljko Ivezic: So I give it some range from Ted. I mean to. And we say, this range, you can have any type of people probability outside, it's forbidden.

107
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:01.000
Zeljko Ivezic: And that's my recipe. Now that defines my problem.

108
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.610
Zeljko Ivezic: And now we are moving to call of.

109
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:20.969
Zeljko Ivezic: So I specify some drivers in practice. You would have to think little bit about your function your day time. What are plausible values? If you are not certain you make it wider, it will take longer to run. But these days

110
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:28.500
Zeljko Ivezic: does it take 1 min or 10 min. It's not big deal. So if you are uncertain, you just by then the space of

111
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:37.969
Zeljko Ivezic: then we have to specify dimensionality of the problem, how many free parameters are we looking for? And that's 7 in our case with 2 Ps.

112
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:53.799
Zeljko Ivezic: And then we will do many things in parallel, and Cmc. Hammer does simultaneously many sets of numbers that later they will average statistically. So that's called Walker, and we'll have 10 100 workers.

113
00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:10.759
Zeljko Ivezic: And then when you are developing, so it's always good habits to say to set random seed. So when you generate random numbers, when you run the same code. Later you'll get exactly the same results. So it is pseudo random number that you control.

114
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:21.490
Zeljko Ivezic: and then you have to set some starting guesses for your 3 parameters. So what did I do in here? I said. Set everything to point 1

115
00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:28.459
Zeljko Ivezic: oh, actually between 0 and point one generates some random values that's not critical.

116
00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.930
Zeljko Ivezic: And then I take

117
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:46.300
Zeljko Ivezic: I take no. What did I do in here? I don't know what it. Oh, no! I just generated something of the correct dimensionality in a stupid way that there is cleaner way to do it. And then I go through this loo of free parameters.

118
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:58.269
Zeljko Ivezic: and I, my starting guess is exactly half of the allowed internal. So that's all. Now, pre setup. And now they call the workforce. So we import them. See.

119
00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:05.930
Zeljko Ivezic: we tell it. You remember we talked about burn in for those chains. Once you start walking around the mountain.

120
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:24.729
Zeljko Ivezic: the initial steps will depend on where we started. It won't be the same if we started in. But you're starting going to meditation. So you you don't want to depend on starting point you want at the end to your number for your numbers to truly

121
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:40.999
Zeljko Ivezic: describe the shape without any memory of the initial steps, without any impact of where you started when you start declining. And so this first part of the chain is from away. It's called burning. It's basically number of steps to get to steady state.

122
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:47.319
Zeljko Ivezic: And so in practice the methods where you can estimate how many of these

123
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:52.819
Zeljko Ivezic: these burning steps you need. But in practice everybody takes a few 1,000, and you have done it.

124
00:18:53.020 --> 00:19:03.570
Zeljko Ivezic: If you had computer from 20 years ago, then you would think hard about, do I really need 5,000? Maybe I can get away with 2,000, because the whole run will take a week.

125
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:16.879
Zeljko Ivezic: But today computers are so fast that in most practical problems you just don't care. You just go conservatively put bigger number same with number of steps. So now I'm asking for 20,000 numbers.

126
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:19.970
Zeljko Ivezic: and 5,000 of them will be thrown away.

127
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:29.720
Zeljko Ivezic: And this is the magic. This is where the magic happens. So this line. I will not execute it here, because it takes about 5 min to generate that

128
00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:35.479
Zeljko Ivezic: this is the call to Mc. That returns that matrix of numbers.

129
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:46.379
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you run it at home, then this time what it say, okay, on my computer, it went in 1 min and 25 s. Okay, so I may. I probably put

130
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:54.570
Zeljko Ivezic: lower number of steps in the originally I recall it was fairly long. 10 min or so. Maybe it was a hundred 1,000 steps. So you call this.

131
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.930
Zeljko Ivezic: And your sampler is now a structure data structure

132
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:05.939
Zeljko Ivezic: where you can now access the numbers. And so this trace

133
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:18.279
Zeljko Ivezic: is set is this set of numbers that we get from that sampler. This is the the magic incantation. and once we have these numbers, these traces

134
00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.299
Zeljko Ivezic: in 7 dimensions. Now we can do any statistics we want.

135
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.910
Zeljko Ivezic: And so in particular, this loop says.

136
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:35.359
Zeljko Ivezic: get my estimate of the best fit parameter is Median. See you, I'm calling Median in here.

137
00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:48.199
Zeljko Ivezic: I define. I'll show actually, first go to picture. This is picture of chains. It looks ugly because the visualization code is not perfect. But basically just look at these contours.

138
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:56.209
Zeljko Ivezic: That is where most of the values are. And this fluff around that is just numerical noise. You can ignore it.

139
00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:01.209
Zeljko Ivezic: You can see that, for example, when you project. So this is your

140
00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:11.599
Zeljko Ivezic: value. And so now I'm saying, if I look at this coordinated this free parameter, I will define my best fit as Median.

141
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:16.220
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's what I'm calling in here. But you can do any other

142
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:24.639
Zeljko Ivezic: statistics. Maybe you are interested in expectation value. Maybe you're interested in standard deviation. For example, here I'm calling standard deviation of that.

143
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.869
Zeljko Ivezic: So then I go through.

144
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:38.860
Zeljko Ivezic: I go through all 7 here, and the first value is true. Second, one is Median, so you can see that they are quite similar. I did find

145
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:48.809
Zeljko Ivezic: correct values. I won't get exactly the input, because there is numerical noise, and that's what's plotted in here. Let me see if I can make this bigger. There we go.

146
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.659
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is one of these parameters, this background.

147
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:58.590
Zeljko Ivezic: And so one, this is median. And then these 2 are determined, as some

148
00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:13.440
Zeljko Ivezic: percentage side. is it in? Yeah, probably 68. So if you had Gaussian distribution, this would be mean plus minus sigma, these ones. But it's asymmetric. Last time someone asked after class. Excellent question.

149
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.340
Zeljko Ivezic: how do you? Numerically, now summarize this?

150
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:26.719
Zeljko Ivezic: And that's basically what's written on top. And in most science favors, you will find that some results say, X equals 10 plus minus 0 point 5.

151
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:43.789
Zeljko Ivezic: But here we have 2 numbers for plus minus, because we are not naive anymore in using just symmetric Gaussian posterior. Now we are getting the true distribution from Mcmc chain. So this is not a Gaussian. But this is what we can tell with our data.

152
00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:55.600
Zeljko Ivezic: This is what we can tell with this given data set about about this free parameter. If we had a much larger dataset.

153
00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.540
Zeljko Ivezic: then this distribution would more.

154
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:17.980
Zeljko Ivezic: we would asymptotically get to Gaussian distribution. And then we could use our analytic approximations. But with this size data set, we cannot. And that's why there are 2 error estimates. So B. Not if you now publish paper about this, you would say, our posterior probability. Distribution is shown in this figure

155
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:45.430
Zeljko Ivezic: and view report be not as 10.0 5, but with as symmetric error bars. So plus no point 11 minus point 0 6. That's the standard for the reporting these. So if you now take 10.0 5 minus 3, those 6, and go to 10.0 5 plus point 1160 of the area under the curve will be enclosed by these 2 numbers.

156
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.019
Zeljko Ivezic: All right. Where did this stuff?

157
00:23:52.360 --> 00:24:05.010
Zeljko Ivezic: And now you can do other statistics. For example, I can ask what is not just my media, and I can ask, What's the minimum value of the one? What is maximum value, etc., etc. So you can play with this

158
00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:13.669
Zeljko Ivezic: later corner I think we already use. That's a little piece of python that plots these multi-dimensional chains.

159
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.990
Zeljko Ivezic: So this plot below was

160
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:20.259
Zeljko Ivezic: plotted by giving it these values from Mc.

161
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:31.919
Zeljko Ivezic: He then then you tell it what is true. If you want to put through it. and then you tell it. Okay. So now I remember, this is where I defined what I want to plot. So it is

162
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:43.640
Zeljko Ivezic: 68. So point 16 missing on this side and point 16. This is cumulative distribution. So this is where I define these numbers. They truly correspond to, plus minus sigma.

163
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:45.730
Zeljko Ivezic: Let me see.

164
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:57.999
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's what you get out of corner plot. Now, there are some better implementations of corner plot where this fluff around is not so

165
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:10.720
Zeljko Ivezic: visible. But for for exercise. It's good enough. If I had to publish this figure in a paper I would work a little bit more on cleaning it up or running longer, or he

166
00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:16.390
Zeljko Ivezic: something along those lines. Okay. So now we, we got our 7 parameters

167
00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.730
Zeljko Ivezic: from the data set. So now we can see.

168
00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.269
Zeljko Ivezic: do they describe what we put in.

169
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:34.260
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now the red line again is the truth. I believe. right through red. Yes, red line is true, and the blue line is our best fit.

170
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:46.219
Zeljko Ivezic: So, using Mcmc, we manage to get the properties of those 2 Ps. Their location and their speed of decay.

171
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.830
Zeljko Ivezic: But we said, we have to. What if we didn't know that there are 2?

172
00:25:52.400 --> 00:26:10.050
Zeljko Ivezic: So if and also here, it's obvious to the I that there are 2, because there is a lot of signal to noise, but in practice one of those 2 could be almost with barely visible about the background. So you you want to have statistical tool that you'll go there and say, Is there one or 2?

173
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.949
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's what we want to do.

174
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:19.710
Zeljko Ivezic: So we will here compute

175
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:26.220
Zeljko Ivezic: by using an information criterion by explicitly calculating guys square

176
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:31.919
Zeljko Ivezic: and by adding a penalty for complexity of the model.

177
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:46.459
Zeljko Ivezic: So this is the formula, so Chi Square is standard for your formula. As always, it's theta minus model, normalized by error, bars squared and some. And this is the Bayesian magic that tells you how exactly to penalize that model.

178
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:56.700
Zeljko Ivezic: So we are not just comparing Price square of 2 models, but we are also penalizing the more complex model proportionally to its number of 3 parameters.

179
00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:08.749
Zeljko Ivezic: And again, if we have 2, first, we have 7, 3 parameters, and if we have one first, we have 4 and 3 parameters. So 2 births model will be penalized more heavily.

180
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:16.499
Zeljko Ivezic: And so it has to show much better description of the data in order to win, because it starts with a penalty.

181
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:22.240
Zeljko Ivezic: So we already did 2 first models. So now this is just a

182
00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:32.820
Zeljko Ivezic: implementation of single bursts model. So the only thing we need to change is to change what is one model. So it's from one model double to one model single.

183
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:40.440
Zeljko Ivezic: And then your priors are now, for your free parameters are now 4 dimensional, not 7 dimensional.

184
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:48.359
Zeljko Ivezic: And so we will call it again. So this is the major client. So we are solving

185
00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:56.980
Zeljko Ivezic: the same problem with the same data set. But we are assuming a different model that has only one birth.

186
00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.659
Zeljko Ivezic: And so then

187
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.619
Zeljko Ivezic: we get some values out. Obviously we cannot have 2

188
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:11.049
Zeljko Ivezic: first. So the blue line now is different. The blue line.

189
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:16.229
Zeljko Ivezic: this fairly good description of one person. but the other person is missing.

190
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:29.390
Zeljko Ivezic: because this model cannot describe to burst. You can only describe one, and because there are more data points around the first first, then it converge to that one verse.

191
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:34.390
Zeljko Ivezic: So now in practice. You're looking at this data set. And you're asking yourself

192
00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:48.499
Zeljko Ivezic: as soon as the second burst is slightly smaller. So it's not obvious from the airplane that it's there. So you're now thinking I might have discovered this boson. Or maybe it's just a noisy data. And if I claim there is a

193
00:28:48.800 --> 00:29:02.960
Zeljko Ivezic: pick, and eventually with more data that pick disappears. Then I feel like an idiot. So you don't want to make arbitrary statements. You want to have statistical approach to it. And that's exactly what B. I, C tells us.

194
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.229
Zeljko Ivezic: So here are the results.

195
00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:09.510
Zeljko Ivezic: So for the single first model.

196
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:13.100
Zeljko Ivezic: we have much higher price for you.

197
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.030
Zeljko Ivezic: then for double

198
00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:25.020
Zeljko Ivezic: double first model is more entirely animals, because it has 7 parameters. But even with that penalty it's B. I, C is still over

199
00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.419
Zeljko Ivezic: so double.

200
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:39.260
Zeljko Ivezic: Of course, in this case it's easy to tell by your but in general, when it's tricky, then this is the approach that that one should follow.

201
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.040
Zeljko Ivezic: So let me now stop here for a second.

202
00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.729
Zeljko Ivezic: Does that make any sense? Did I miss something?

203
00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.719
Zeljko Ivezic: You think you could do that for homework when you came home.

204
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:57.219
Zeljko Ivezic: If I said, Use Gaussians, generate your own simulation and try up to 5

205
00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:04.030
Zeljko Ivezic: because of something you feel like. This code is simple enough that you to modify it for your needs.

206
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:12.020
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay. so now for completeness.

207
00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:21.290
Zeljko Ivezic: let me mention another method that people often use, especially in computer science. So

208
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.940
Zeljko Ivezic: back to that polynomial problem.

209
00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:30.640
Zeljko Ivezic: Is there another way to decide what is the optimal

210
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:39.650
Zeljko Ivezic: order of your polynomial for data? Of course it generalizes to to any problem. But because we already did polynomials. Let's go back to that example.

211
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:51.669
Zeljko Ivezic: Do you need to? You have to use the IC or or full by as a consultation or not. Actually, the answer is, you don't have to. There is a proximate method called cross-volidation

212
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.660
Zeljko Ivezic: that was developed by computer scientists.

213
00:30:54.870 --> 00:31:05.729
Zeljko Ivezic: It makes sense. When you, when you look at it, but it's not as sound theoretically as full by Asian approach, but it works empirically. So what is this?

214
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:11.979
Zeljko Ivezic: So I take my polynomial, and I fit it. And here you can see that

215
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:28.110
Zeljko Ivezic: with the second order I'm not describing my data points it third order. I'm happy. But then, how do I know that I shouldn't go to any higher orders? And how should I automatically know that d equals 2 is not good enough without

216
00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:39.690
Zeljko Ivezic: wanting things, or or in complicated. complicated cases. So there is very simple and ingenious method which says. Take a fraction of your data points

217
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.459
Zeljko Ivezic: and don't use them for fitting.

218
00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:50.879
Zeljko Ivezic: So I like, if you have 100 data points, use 80 for fitting and take 20 or testing after you have best fit.

219
00:31:52.440 --> 00:32:02.089
Zeljko Ivezic: That's called cross validation. So you have validation, sample, and then you evaluate your best fit. And then you ask, How well does it fit

220
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:07.489
Zeljko Ivezic: those 20 validation points? You look at model minus data, is it?

221
00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:10.239
Zeljko Ivezic: If your model is too simple.

222
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:25.180
Zeljko Ivezic: then you will have large bias, meaning that distribution will be significant. The way from 0. So if you look at D equal. 2. If you now imagine that every other point is validation point.

223
00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:36.680
Zeljko Ivezic: you can see that many of these points have model that is far away from them. So your bias in the sample would be large. Now, if you go to the 19, for example.

224
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:42.740
Zeljko Ivezic: that's such a high order that it goes literally through every data point.

225
00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:44.340
Zeljko Ivezic: So

226
00:32:44.410 --> 00:33:01.680
Zeljko Ivezic: here you will get large, scatter away. Although bias is small. When you take validation sample, you can get. You mentioned that there was data point where it is polynomial went far, far away. If there was validation point there you would see it as huge schedule.

227
00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:05.379
Zeljko Ivezic: So the advantage of cross- validation method is

228
00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:13.200
Zeljko Ivezic: that it's extremely easy to implement, even in the most complicated cases, in the most complex models.

229
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:22.950
Zeljko Ivezic: You just state fraction of the sample, typically 2030% of data points. And you use that for validation as you know how well you are doing.

230
00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:34.049
Zeljko Ivezic: So you could get the same result from by Asian approach. But sometimes, when you have many variables, and it's complicated to do numerical integration that you need to do it

231
00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:56.579
Zeljko Ivezic: with base approach, or when when it's expensive, to get M. Cmc. Chains. But just model evaluation is complicated. For example, if you're looking at galaxy distribution on the sky. You want to look at their statistics of their distribution, then you need to run a full simulation of galaxy, plus their formation, etcetera, things that can take months. And so the computers.

232
00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:01.459
Zeljko Ivezic: not these simple functions that we have here for birth, but actually, each

233
00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:12.459
Zeljko Ivezic: evaluation in your Mcmc chain takes months, then you cannot have chain of 10,000 points. So that's hard. In that case you can still get away by using cross- validation method.

234
00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:15.549
Zeljko Ivezic: because it's so simple and

235
00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:20.240
Zeljko Ivezic: easily implementable. So that's another way to test what you did.

236
00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:27.580
Zeljko Ivezic: And this is basically what what I said in words.

237
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.839
Zeljko Ivezic: So the the top panel.

238
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:33.280
Zeljko Ivezic: So this example of F in the polynomial.

239
00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:42.340
Zeljko Ivezic: and then on the y-axis, it shows rms, root, mean square error, or scatter of that model of given degree.

240
00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:47.599
Zeljko Ivezic: And so at the beginning, the solid line goes down. It's our training sample.

241
00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:53.940
Zeljko Ivezic: I think of it as 80% of all data points. And then I took away 20

242
00:34:54.290 --> 00:35:08.270
Zeljko Ivezic: percent of data points. I use them for cross-colidation. And so now for both of them. Rms, goes down as I increase the order of the polynomial. and then at some point for the training sample.

243
00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:24.499
Zeljko Ivezic: I am fitting it perfectly well, and any additional polynomial, or there will not too much good. I'm already fitting it as well as it can be done. But for cross-solidation, sample the dash line at some point, starts going up.

244
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:41.510
Zeljko Ivezic: and that's over fitting. That's the example that they had in here that this polynomial can go widely away from data points that you use to fit. So if you had validation point here you would immediately see huge schedule. And so that's what's happening in the top panel. So

245
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:46.669
Zeljko Ivezic: order of the polynomial. When my cross validation starts going crazy.

246
00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:54.199
Zeljko Ivezic: 5. It was it? 6, 6. So they are. I know I shouldn't go to my owners. So from Trust Foundation, I would say

247
00:35:54.520 --> 00:36:00.500
Zeljko Ivezic: third, fourth, fifth, maybe sixth order. Polynomial is the best. and the bottom.

248
00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:07.870
Zeljko Ivezic: The bottom panel shows the same thing. But instead of Rms error, it shows why you see an information criterion

249
00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:16.789
Zeljko Ivezic: they are. You don't need cross-colidation, you know already, from the training sample. What's the best polynomial order that you need order 3.

250
00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:21.099
Zeljko Ivezic: But in it. That's similar. First, to go down until you reach

251
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:37.310
Zeljko Ivezic: the level of fitting. That is good. And then something needs to tell you. Stop, don't go there that's too complicated in Bayesian approach. You have the penalty that is proportional to the number of free parameters in cross- validation. It comes out like that

252
00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:46.290
Zeljko Ivezic: just starts going up because you are over fitting your data set and your training sample tells you you are over fitting.

253
00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.710
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's also a powerful method to to use.

254
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:58.260
Zeljko Ivezic: And the last topic I want to cover in this lecture is

255
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:03.299
Zeljko Ivezic: how to do histograms, how to do optimal instagram.

256
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:08.530
Zeljko Ivezic: So with histograms. we take our data

257
00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:20.399
Zeljko Ivezic: is this visible, not perfect? But we take our data, which is shown here as good Instagram, and then we've done it. And then we calculate. This is very

258
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:39.259
Zeljko Ivezic: if we calculate heights in each bin, and then from the square root of the number of data points in that we calculate uncertainty. and then by saying, histogram, what we usually need is that we have actually distant in positions.

259
00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:46.129
Zeljko Ivezic: Now, if your data set is not very large, they are exactly. You place your bins

260
00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.189
Zeljko Ivezic: so you can shift them left and right by 1 min.

261
00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:57.669
Zeljko Ivezic: Your result can depend on where exactly you put it. I won't go there. It happens only for very small data sets.

262
00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:02.529
Zeljko Ivezic: but then you also need to know what's been with. You will choose.

263
00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:12.609
Zeljko Ivezic: So how do you choose that then with is also a little bit of the application of by using a statistics in an optimal sense.

264
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:25.040
Zeljko Ivezic: So the stupidest thing you can do is it's just to say an equal standard. I want 10 min sounds funny, but that's how it works in excel spreadsheet. That's the default. But it itself

265
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.699
Zeljko Ivezic: in the reality. You want to have something that depends on your data

266
00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:43.290
Zeljko Ivezic: set size, not if you have many, many, many data points, then of course, we can make smaller and smaller events to cover lots of structure. If you have only 10 data points, you can't have many bills.

267
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:49.829
Zeljko Ivezic: And so there are different ways of computing this, and from the Bayesian point of view

268
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:56.580
Zeljko Ivezic: the there is one answer, and then the answer is called, not histogram after not, or

269
00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:05.599
Zeljko Ivezic: of what's his first name, I forget. he is a physicist from from New York. so you can call

270
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:10.739
Zeljko Ivezic: Astral Ml. To there, is it? Now here plot times if I'm hang on a second.

271
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:14.339
Zeljko Ivezic: There we go. So there is

272
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:29.180
Zeljko Ivezic: fancy histogram. That's what Jake Fender, plus Covid who who wrote the code in. So that's already implemented for you. The standard methods like this Friedman D upon his, and and not histogram, is there too, and it's easy to use it.

273
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:36.469
Zeljko Ivezic: So instead of calling histogram you call fancy histogram from astronaut, and then

274
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:39.800
Zeljko Ivezic: and then

275
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:44.949
Zeljko Ivezic: what? None name that the name disappear

276
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:53.810
Zeljko Ivezic:  Maybe I deleted an intention or something.

277
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:59.929
Zeljko Ivezic: This makes no sense. Fancy histogram needs to take a name of

278
00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.820
Zeljko Ivezic: what? Oh, I'm being blind histogram time.

279
00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:08.049
Zeljko Ivezic: That's where no hang on a second

280
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:12.490
Zeljko Ivezic: fancy histogram. Friedman

281
00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:18.410
Zeljko Ivezic: style. Okay, then it is

282
00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:24.829
Zeljko Ivezic: pins. Oh, here, Vince Econ style, this is where you define what kind of histogram you want.

283
00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:37.090
Zeljko Ivezic: And so in particular, here we are calling standard computer science methods. Both. Friedman Jacon is just to demonstrate the method that method works. If you have unit model distributions.

284
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:44.509
Zeljko Ivezic: If you now have by model distribution, or even more complicated structure. That method sometimes can give you crazy results.

285
00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:48.920
Zeljko Ivezic: So especially if you have no Gaussian distributions like here, too.

286
00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:59.570
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you did standard method to get your bin with optimal been made for such distribution as shown in here, you would not get the optimal answer.

287
00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:07.400
Zeljko Ivezic: Sometimes when you have huge data set, you just don't care if you have huge data sets, then you're not very sensitive to the statistical

288
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:19.159
Zeljko Ivezic: except systematics and so on. But if you don't, then you need to do what's optimal. And so in this case it's this, not histogram that you simply specify

289
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:28.090
Zeljko Ivezic: this keyboard, and it will do full Bayesian model optimization to give you the optimal bin size.

290
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:41.749
Zeljko Ivezic: So that's recommended method for histograms. Whenever you want to do histogram in the future. Remember that. Call offensive histogram from us to Ml, and you will get statistically optimal. Answer

291
00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:47.230
Zeljko Ivezic: the answer you cannot beat statistically. That's the answer. Now.

292
00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:53.690
Zeljko Ivezic: that will be the result. Under the assumption that you won't constant deal with.

293
00:41:54.750 --> 00:42:02.449
Zeljko Ivezic: If you are willing to make that sacrifice and say all my bins have the same with, then this is your answer.

294
00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:10.480
Zeljko Ivezic: but sometimes in practice we don't want. and you can ask why. And so let me first show you a plot.

295
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:13.730
Zeljko Ivezic: So in the top panel

296
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:18.300
Zeljko Ivezic: you can see this little mark on X-axis.

297
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:22.120
Zeljko Ivezic: These are data values. They might

298
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.730
Zeljko Ivezic: where we generated the sample.

299
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.149
Zeljko Ivezic: and there are more of them faster than this size

300
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:38.680
Zeljko Ivezic: side with on the other side. That's because they were generated from this like line I made artificial.

301
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:43.790
Zeljko Ivezic: That has 2

302
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.059
Zeljko Ivezic: that quickly. It's generated above.

303
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:56.000
Zeljko Ivezic: These are free parameters. It's some in no, it's all cushy distribution. So it's not even Gaussian.

304
00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:08.329
Zeljko Ivezic: So this sum of 4 by plans for. And then I generate my data points. And of course, I have more data points from where the distributions are.

305
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:14.290
Zeljko Ivezic: and in particular, on the top panel that should be number 100, I believe. Yeah, 100 points.

306
00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:27.189
Zeljko Ivezic: So I give you this 100 numbers, and they then ask you, what do you think is the best description of number one.

307
00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:36.760
Zeljko Ivezic: And so with that many points you can say I, and

308
00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:39.430
Zeljko Ivezic: just village, and what?

309
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:47.100
Zeljko Ivezic: And the question is, how many things you want. So sometimes you can be eager for structure. You can have 2 benefits.

310
00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:53.270
Zeljko Ivezic: But as we just learned not his background is, he answered, and as the the brown.

311
00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:56.810
Zeljko Ivezic: There's the open up statistical restriction

312
00:43:56.830 --> 00:44:02.280
Zeljko Ivezic: of those points on X.

313
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:11.430
Zeljko Ivezic: But we are assuming constant bandwidth is not the best thing we can do. And the reason is that your data points are very clever.

314
00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:26.159
Zeljko Ivezic: So if you go back to the beginning of Instagram discussion, I said, when you have a bin. You put data points, and then that's the height of histogram. And then the uncertainty is square root of end. It's for some statistics.

315
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:33.389
Zeljko Ivezic: For that reason. The fact that your uncertainty goes with square root of the number of points you want

316
00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:46.339
Zeljko Ivezic: histogram with David to be dependent on the density of points, because when you have lots of data points, you have lots of statistical information, you can afford narrow evidence.

317
00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:51.099
Zeljko Ivezic: And if you go to the details of the distribution where you don't add

318
00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:54.800
Zeljko Ivezic: many data points, then you want a wider payment.

319
00:44:55.980 --> 00:45:14.259
Zeljko Ivezic: And so now there is this method called by aes and blocks that that's almost identical thing model optimization like, not histogram. But now it the schools that you can have arbitrary invent. So basically what it says is, I will put bandwidth at some number of locations

320
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:30.769
Zeljko Ivezic: and some number, and then you solve for the best feature for those locations using by Asian model comparison. It is, if you look at the original paper, there are, you derive this formula. It's like 3 pages of long formula.

321
00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:47.040
Zeljko Ivezic: And also you need to do some special tricks in in when solving it. But it's now all implemented, and this best possible method, from the Bayesian point of view, is now available to you for for use like in this example. What we did was simply to say.

322
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:52.280
Zeljko Ivezic: do the call histogram code instead of notes? Just say blocks

323
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:56.290
Zeljko Ivezic: as easy as that, and it's a powerful method.

324
00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:06.619
Zeljko Ivezic: This is not just matter of do I hope my sister can come with you or not? That's again, how much information you can extract from your later set.

325
00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:16.729
Zeljko Ivezic: and so now compare from there the bottom of the bottom panel and the middle panel. So here we have

326
00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:21.029
Zeljko Ivezic: brown piece of the ground doesn't know, for the middle of

327
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:29.739
Zeljko Ivezic: round. Instagram did not recognize it up there. It's too wide here to brown. Histogram did not recognize this bill of.

328
00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:34.989
Zeljko Ivezic: But when you do it, you know, statistically

329
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:52.019
Zeljko Ivezic: in the top panel by Asian blocks didn't do much better because it's more data sample. But now we larger data sample. There is a size of data sample where you will pick the middle pick with the red histogram with Bayesian blocks. You will discover it's 30,

330
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:56.870
Zeljko Ivezic: we standard classical.

331
00:46:57.530 --> 00:47:01.560
Zeljko Ivezic: And why is that important? It's important, because this could be on local pricing

332
00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:10.620
Zeljko Ivezic: physics or biology or chemistry, or whatever it is, discovery of some information in our data that we get by using optimal methods

333
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:14.220
Zeljko Ivezic: as opposed to non-optimal methods.

334
00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:16.929
Zeljko Ivezic: So if your data set is small.

335
00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:20.590
Zeljko Ivezic: whatever you do will not be powerful.

336
00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:30.520
Zeljko Ivezic: If your data set is super large, then you can get away it simple methods. But between those 2 extremes, very often in practice there is a data set size

337
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:39.440
Zeljko Ivezic: where, with modern optic mount methods, you can discover more in your data than if you're using just classical standard methods.

338
00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:48.640
Zeljko Ivezic: So from now on. Whenever you do histogram, remember our lectures and then run these 2 pieces of code and see what you get.

339
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:51.930
Zeljko Ivezic: That's easy to use, because you just need to install a.

340
00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:07.919
Zeljko Ivezic: So I'm stopping earlier today because of some other obligations. But we still have a few minutes for discussion of lecture today

341
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:21.829
Zeljko Ivezic: and or discussion of the whole series of. and I would like to get feedback from you about, how can I improve lecture so that the next time when we go through the next 6 lectures.

342
00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.549
Zeljko Ivezic: it fits your needs and style, etc. More.

343
00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:38.510
Zeljko Ivezic: So we can discuss now what would be improved. Or you can send me private email and say, you know, the rolling class is that when you do this it could be approved, or

344
00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:43.060
Zeljko Ivezic: what kind of. So I open more for discussion.

345
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:47.279
Zeljko Ivezic: questions about lecture, about all 6 lectures or

346
00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.349
Zeljko Ivezic: so.

347
00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:56.750
Zeljko Ivezic: See, I originally expected maybe 10 people, 15 people.

348
00:48:56.870 --> 00:49:04.269
Zeljko Ivezic: that I would be able to work individually with everyone, and even give some little projects to people, and so on.

349
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:13.210
Zeljko Ivezic: And then there was Ceasefield, and that was impossible to too many people. But I'm hoping that you tried at home to run this code.

350
00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:26.130
Zeljko Ivezic: It's okay to come to class and listen. But unless you do your hands with your brain, unless you install the code, try to break it. Try to apply to some research problem that you may have for homework or for your

351
00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:36.829
Zeljko Ivezic: thesis of various types. Try to use the code. That's how you learn. Otherwise it will be. Yeah. I remember us. It was bubbling about something 2 years ago, but I don't remember it.

352
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:40.679
Zeljko Ivezic: To get the knowledge, you really need to try it.

353
00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.310
Zeljko Ivezic: Questions.

354
00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.660
Zeljko Ivezic: I'll show the dance again.

355
00:49:53.220 --> 00:50:09.670
Zeljko Ivezic: Okay, you're sorry. American students. They you are safe questions, they start stopping immediately. They are not that actually sometimes borderline and on  well, if there are no questions.

356
00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:19.079
Zeljko Ivezic: and then again, please do send me, if you have to, for how to improve lectures. how to make them more useful for you.

357
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:29.330
Zeljko Ivezic: just send me. I will send email to everyone on the list about new dates. Roughly. By the end of October

358
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:40.420
Zeljko Ivezic: there will be another call for other people to join. Who wants? But if there is space limitation, then you will get advantage. So whoever it was taking the first half of plus, it's the

359
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.700
Zeljko Ivezic: well. Then thank you again for coming to class for being excellent students and for showing interest.

360
00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:55.559
Zeljko Ivezic: It was fun going through this lectures, and I hope to see you sooner.

361
00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:56.990
Zeljko Ivezic: Thank you.

362
00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:15.690
Akshay Kumar Remeshan: It's a I think there is a question in the chat. Thank you, guys. And zoom, I'm logging off. There is a question in the chat

363
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:29.849
Zeljko Ivezic: bill. Increasing points work for node past 10,000. Yeah, it did. In the bottom panel. You can see that even the the simpler method is picking up the middle, that middle peak.

364
00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:39.799
Zeljko Ivezic: So, as we said. If you have small data set, then no statistics will help you. If you have huge data sets, then often you don't even need statistics.

365
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:44.639
Zeljko Ivezic: But in the middle of those 2 extremes, like the bottom, like the middle panel.

366
00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:50.940
Zeljko Ivezic: If you use better method, you can find more stuff than me. Non-optimal methodology.

367
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:54.020
Zeljko Ivezic: Does that answer your question?

368
00:51:55.170 --> 00:52:06.780
Zeljko Ivezic: It's hard for me to hear. Because, okay, thanks, Damian. it's hard to here because of people. So I'm logging off. Thank you for coming on, zoom, and take care.
